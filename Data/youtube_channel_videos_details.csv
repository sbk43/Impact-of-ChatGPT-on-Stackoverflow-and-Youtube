UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,DeepLearningAI,K6Wui3mn-uI,How To Read AI Research Papers Effectively,"According to a recent survey, over two-thirds (66.9%) of developers and machine learning teams are planning production deployments of LLM apps in the next 12 months or “as fast as possible” – and 14.1% are already in production! Given the rapid rate of progress and constant drumbeat of new foundation models, orchestration frameworks and open source libraries – as well as the workaday challenges of getting an app into production – it can be difficult to find the time to digest and read the dizzying array of cutting-edge AI research papers hitting arXiv. 

That task has never been more critical, however, as the time between academic discovery and industry application moves from years to weeks. How can teams discover and read AI research papers quickly without losing nuance, with an eye toward pragmatic application, while balancing real-world challenges?

In this session, Aparna Dhinakaran – who blends a background in academia with experience overseeing AI in production and troubleshooting real-world AI systems as co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Arize AI – will be joined by data scientist and machine learning engineer Amber Roberts to talk through strategies for understanding and applying the latest research, reducing mean time to application.

UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,DeepLearningAI,fo0F-DAum7E,Building Production-Grade LLM Apps,"Last year, GenAI experimentation spread like wildfire. Developers tinkered with new foundation models, data, and use cases. However, a relatively low percentage of projects moved from prototypes to production to drive real-world impact. One significant reason for this is ensuring app trustworthiness: Is an app reliable, accurate, or fair enough to be unleashed on the world? Which app responses are hallucinatory, which ones are unsafe? Could we identify issues and mitigate them during app development and in production to meet the quality level that end users need?

This year, organizations are taking their learnings from experimentation and focusing on creating and iterating enterprise-grade apps that will be reliable in the harsher realities of production environments.

How can you make your apps enterprise grade? In this webinar, technical leaders from Pinecone and TruEra will share how to create apps that are high quality and production ready. The principles will be illustrated with Pinecone Canopy and TruLens, and notebooks will be available for participants to explore.

In this workshop, you will learn: 

What do you need to create enterprise-ready AI models and apps? Your current stack might have some gaps in it. Here’s what’s working.
What do you need to evaluate and iterate on apps quickly, so that you can gain confidence that your app is ready for production?
Rapid response - what happens when an app generates a hallucinatory or irrelevant or unsafe response? How to monitor, recognize when your app is in trouble and quickly get it back on the rails.

UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,DeepLearningAI,f32dc5M2Mn0,Prompt-Engineering for Open-Source LLMs,"Turns out prompt-engineering is different for open-source LLMs! Actually, your prompts need to be engineered when switching across any LLM — even when OpenAI changes versions behind the scenes, which is why people get confused why their prompts don’t work anymore. Transparency of the entire prompt is critical to effectively squeezing out performance from the model. Most frameworks struggle with this, as they try to abstract everything away or obscure the prompt to seem like they’re managing something behind the scenes. But prompt-engineering is not software engineering, so the workflow is entirely different to succeed. Finally, RAG, a form of prompt-engineering, is an easy way to boost performance using search technology. In fact, you only need 80 lines of code to implement the whole thing and get 80%+ of what you need from it (link to open-source repo). You’ll learn how to run RAG at scale, across millions of documents.

What you’ll learn from this workshop:

- Prompt engineering vs. software engineering
- Open vs. closed LLMs: completely different prompts
- Push accuracy by taking advantage of prompt transparency
- Best practices for prompt-engineering open LLMs
- Prompt-engineering with search (RAG)
- How to implement RAG on millions of documents (demo)

UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,DeepLearningAI,kH4ZoZSvddM,Navigating LLM Threats: Detecting Prompt Injections and Jailbreaks,"*Every time a new technology emerges, some people will inevitably attempt to use it maliciously – language models are no exception. Recently, we have seen numerous examples of attacks on large language models (LLMs). These attacks elicit restricted behavior from language models, such as producing hate speech, creating misinformation, leaking private information, or misleading the model into performing a different task than intended.

In this hands-on workshop, we will examine differences in navigating natural and algorithmic adversarial attacks, concentrating on prompt injections and jailbreaks. We first explore a few examples of how such attacks are generated via state-of-the-art cipher and language suffix approaches. We then focus on adaptive strategies for detecting these attacks in LLM-based applications using LangKit, our open-source package for feature extraction for LLM and NLP applications, with practical examples and limitation considerations. Namely, semantic similarity against a set of known attacks and LLM-based proactive detection techniques.two approaches for detecting the attacks with LangKit.

By the end of this workshop, attendees will understand:

*What LLM prompt injections and jailbreaks are and measures to mitigate those attacks
*How to use semantic similarity techniques to verify incoming prompts against a set of known jailbreak and prompt injection attacks
*How to use LLM-based proactive detection techniques to preemptively detect prompt injection attacks

UCcIXc5mJsHVYTZR1maL5l9w,DeepLearningAI,ewfTtQUvfJU,New short course: Advanced Retrieval for AI with Chroma,"Enroll now: https://bit.ly/3RD9tgK

Information Retrieval (IR) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are only effective if the information retrieved from a database as a result of a query is relevant to the query and its application. 

Too often, queries return semantically similar results but don’t answer the question posed. They may also return irrelevant material which can distract the LLM from the correct results. 

This course, built in collaboration with Chroma, teaches advanced retrieval techniques to improve the relevancy of retrieved results.

The techniques covered include:  

- Query Expansion: Expanding user queries improves information retrieval by including related concepts and keywords. Utilizing an LLM makes this traditional technique even more effective. - Another form of expansion has the LLM suggest a possible answer to the query which is then included in the query.
- Cross-encoder reranking: Reranking retrieval results to select the results most relevant to your query improves your results
- Training and utilizing Embedding Adapters: Adding an adapter layer to reshape embeddings can improve retrieval by emphasizing elements relevant to your application.

However, this math can be done quickly using matrix math because GPUs are optimized for it. Matrix math is also used when we code neural networks, so learning how ChatGPT does it will help you code your own. Thus, in this video, we go through the math one step at a time and explain what each step does so that you can use it on your own with confidence.

It's also surprisingly simple, but often poorly explained. Traditionally the equation is presented with the expectation that you memorize it without thoroughly understanding what it means and where it came from. This video takes a very different approach by showing you, step-by-step, where this simple equation comes from, making it easy to remember (and derive), understand and explain to your friends at parties.

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Xz0x-8-cgaQ,Bootstrapping Main Ideas!!!,"Bootstrapping is one of the simplest, yet most powerful methods in all of statistics. It provides us an easy way to get a sense of what might happen if we could repeat an experiment a bunch of times. It turns point estimates into distributions that can be used to calculate all kinds of stuff, including standard errors, confidence intervals and even p-values. In this video, we show how it can be used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals. In Part 2, we'll see how to calculate p-values.

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,OSPr6G6Ka-U,Expected Values for Continuous Variables!!!,"If you ever muck around in statistics, it's not long before you see E(x) = something. These are expected values. Expected Values for Continuous Variables are a little trickier than their discrete counterparts because we have to do some calculus. However, I'll walk you through it, one step at a time, so don't sweat it! BAM!

NOTE: This one is, believe it or not, pretty near to my heart. When I was taking Statistical Theory in graduate school (from Rodger Berger of Casella and Berger, who wrote the standard textbook on statistical theory, ""Statistical Inference"") I remember having a lot of trouble with expected values. They intimidated me for two reasons 1) deriving them seemed like total luck and 2) I never understood, exactly, what the formula for continuous variables meant in a deep way. I could look at the equation and name the parts, but that was all I could do. Anyway, fast forward a few years and here I am, going back to these basics, this time determined to get that ""deep understanding"" I missed before, and, at least for myself, I succeeded. And I hope that means other people will also be able to get a deep understanding of expected values as well.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes that you are already familiar with the concept of an Expected Value. If not, check out the 'Quest: https://youtu.be/KLs_7b7SKi4

14:24 I meant to say ""larger"" instead of ""lower.
18:48  In the original XGBoost documents they use the epsilon symbol to refer to the learning rate, but in the actual implementation, this is controlled via the ""eta"" parameter. So, I guess to be consistent with the original documentation, I made the same mistake! :)

16:50 I say ""66"", but I meant to say ""62.48"". However, either way, the conclusion is the same.
22:03 In the original XGBoost documents they use the epsilon symbol to refer to the learning rate, but in the actual implementation, this is controlled via the ""eta"" parameter. So, I guess to be consistent with the original documentation, I made the same mistake! :)

It also describes why we square each term instead of taking the absolute value. The visuals used in this StatQuest make it easy to remember why we should divide by n-1, and this will save us from falling into a very common pitfall.

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,vMh0zPT0tLI,"Stochastic Gradient Descent, Clearly Explained!!!","Even though Stochastic Gradient Descent sounds fancy, it is just a simple addition to ""regular"" Gradient Descent. This video sets up the problem that Stochastic Gradient Descent solves and then shows how it does it. Along the way, we discuss situations where Stochastic Gradient Descent is most useful, and some cool features that aren't that obvious.

NOTE: There is a small typo at 9:03. The values for the intercept and slope should be the most recent estimates, 0.86 and 0.68, instead of the original random values, 0 and 1.

NOTE: This StatQuest assumes you already understand ""regular"" Gradient Descent. If not, check out the 'Quest: https://youtu.be/sDv4f4s2SB8

When I was researching Stochastic Gradient Descent, I found a ton of cool websites that provided lots of details. Here are some of my favorites:

Sebastian Ruder has a nice write-up: http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,StWY5QWMXCw,Gradient Boost Part 4 (of 4): Classification Details,"At last, part 4 in our series of videos on Gradient Boost. This time we dive deep into the details of how it is used for classification, going through algorithm, and the math behind it, one step at a time. Specifically, we derive the loss function from the log(likelihood) of the data and we derive the functions used to calculate the output values from the leaves in each tree. This one is long, but well worth if you want to know how Gradient Boost works.

NOTE: There is a minor error at 7:01. It should just say log(p) - log(1-p) = log(p/(1-p)). And at 19:10 I forgot to put ""L"" in front of some of the loss functions. However, it should be clear what they are since I point to them say, ""This is the loss function"".

6:58 log(p) - log(1-p) is not equal to log(p)/log(1-p) but equal to log(p/(1-p)). In other words, the result at 7:07,  log(p) - log(1-p) = log(odds), is correct, and thus, the error does not propagate beyond it's short, but embarrassing moment. 
26:53, my indexing of the variables gets off. This is unfortunate, but you should still be able to follow the concepts.

The Wikipedia article on Gradient Boosting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting
NOTE: The key to understanding how the wikipedia article relates to this video is to keep reading past the ""pseudo algorithm"" section. The very next section in the article called ""Gradient Tree Boosting"" shows how the algorithm works for trees (which is pretty much the only weak learner people ever use for gradient boost, which is why I focus on it in the video). In that section, you see how the equation is modified so that each leaf from a tree can have a different output value, rather than the entire ""weak learner"" having a single output value - and this is the exact same equation that I use in the video.
Later in the article, in the section called ""Shrinkage"", they show how the learning rate can be included. Since this is also pretty much always used with gradient boost, I simply included it in the base algorithm that I describe.

Corrections:
4:27 The sum on the left hand side should be in parentheses to make it clear that the entire sum is multiplied by 1/2, not just the first term.
15:47. It should be R_jm, not R_ij. 
16:18, the leaf in the script is R_1,2 and it should be R_2,1.
21:08. With regression trees, the sample will only go to a single leaf, and this summation simply isolates the one output value of interest from all of the others. However, when I first made this video I was thinking that because Gradient Boost is supposed to work with any ""weak learner"", not just small regression trees, that this summation was a way to add flexibility to the algorithm.
24:15, the header for the residual column should be r_i,2.

Specifically, I was thinking about Swift's line in the last chorus, ""Say you'll remember me even if it's just pretend"". I thought to myself, ""what if I wrote a song about some guy who's 'pretending'?"", and the thought made me laugh out loud. So here's my song about ""pretending"".

Here, take this cup have a drink from the well
Then lend me your ear I’ve a story to tell
Not long ago there was a castle and a prince
And a maiden so fair all surrounded by a fence

Inside those walls the gardens grew lush and green
But the walls themselves were a sight so obscene
A head on each post they were a warning to us all
To keep on our side not to question the wall

A knight from our side saw the maiden from afar
(And) he was drawn to the fence like a moth to a star
So he climbed up the wall and made his way across the lawn
But the prince acted fast and stabbed the knight before the dawn

So look over there, you’ll see his head upon a post
And this is what he said before he gave up the ghost
“Alas, sweet revenge won’t be a story I can tell
but I saw the maiden put poison in the well.”

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,Rvm1aMwcraY,Christmas Morning,"Here's song #71. Every year I write and record a new holiday themed song in November (to be released at the start of December), but this year I wondered, ""do I really need to write another holiday song?"". I wasn't feeling it. However, one morning while I was making breakfast this song just came out of nowhere. 30 minutes later, I had the whole thing worked out (on paper - at least - recording took a little longer...)

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,OxA6i3iJd7M,Miss Carolina,"Here's song #68! The song had two sources of inspiration:

#1: A Gillian Welch song called ""Look at Miss Ohio"", that has the lines:

Oh me oh my oh
Look at Miss Ohio
She’s a running around with her rag-top down
She says ""I wanna do right but not right now""

...anyway - I was biking home from work and I was standing at the intersection of Henderson and Rosemary and I thought of that song and I started to sing about ""Miss North Carolina"" as if she were some sort of trouble maker. From there it turned into ""I miss Carolina, when am I gonna head back home"" - a song about a North Carolina exile that wants to come home. So, that was inspiration #1.

#2 Once I had this idea of ""I miss Carolina"", I started to think about all the political rabble rousing that's going on in the state - and this was before the Silent Sam thing happened (a bunch of people knocked over Silent Sam a few weeks ago) - they've got these crazy state constitutional amendments that are coming out of no where that we are supposed to vote on. One of them declares that ""hunting and fishing will be the primary means for managing fish and wildlife populations"". Stupid stuff that seems like old folk trying to make it harder to young folk to get anything done in the state. So then the song went back to ""Miss Carolina"" - she being the true spirit of the state - she's gone and left us all covered in pretty weeds, but still weeds.

NOTE: I specifically used the antiquated term ""Miss"" instead of the more modern ""Ms"" because ""Miss"" is still used for beauty pageants - when the state picks the woman who most embodies the ""spirit"" of the state - she's beautiful, but also smart, caring and determined to change the world for the better. She's the one that's gone and we need her back.

8:53 I meant to say ""the remaining 198.7 people without the mutated gene"".
14:27 I correctly wrote ""If the tests worked as expected, 5% should have p-values less than 0.05"". That is correct. However, when recording the voiceover, I said ""5% should have p-values less than 0.5"", which is not correct.

It can be used to identify patterns in highly complex datasets and it can tell you what variables in your data are the most important. Lastly, it can tell you how accurate your new understanding of the data actually is.

In this video, I go one step at a time through PCA, and the method used to solve it, Singular Value Decomposition. I take it nice and slowly so that the simplicity of the method is revealed and clearly explained.

Here's one of those tricky little things, Probability vs. Likelihood. In common conversation we use these words interchangeably. However, statisticians make a clear distinction that is important to understand if you want to follow their logic. The good news is that they are both super simple. The bad news is that they are easy to get mixed up. The StatQuest gives you visual images that make them both easy to remember so you'll always keep them straight.

3:18 I should have said the same feature (or variable) can be selected multiple times in a tree. Every time we select a subset of features to choose from, we choose from the full list of features, even if we have already used some of those features. Thus, a single feature can appear multiple times in a tree.

Here are the lyrics:

When I am feeling down
When I am exhausted
When I am at my end (again)
When I have been broken

When I am feeling scared
When I’m full of worries
When I can only doubt (myself)
You come to me
You come to me
You comfort me

When I am overwhelmed
When sadness becomes me
When the simplest of things
Brings me to ruin

A feather in the wind
and life turns to ashes
When the things I love can’t last
You come to me
You come to me
You comfort me

When you are in my arms
Your head on my shoulder (near my heart)
When I feel you close to me
When you ease my burden

When you hold my hand
It feels right for the first time.
When you smile at me
You bring me calm
You bring me calm
You comfort me

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,GEn-_dAyYME,StatQuest: MDS and PCoA,"MDS (multi-dimensional scaling) and PCoA (principal coordinate analysis) are very, very similar to PCA (principal component analysis). There really only one small difference, but that difference means you need to know what you're doing if you're going to use MDS effectively. This video make sure you learn what you need to know to use MDS and PCoA.

There is a minor error at 4:14: The difference for gene 3 should be (2.2 - 1)². Instead the distance for gene 2 was repeated.

UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,okjYjClSjOg,"Quantile-Quantile Plots (QQ plots), Clearly Explained!!!","Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots are used to determine if data can be approximated by a statistical distribution. For example, you might collect some data and wonder if it is normally distributed. A QQ plot will help you answer that question. You can also use QQ plots to compare to different datasets that you collected to determine if their distributions are comparable. This video shows you how to do both things.

NOTE: The data in this video are measures of gene expression. If ""gene expression"" doesn't mean anything to you, just imagine that the data represents how tall a bunch of people are, or how much they weigh. Then consider the y-axis to be the height or weight of the people, and the x-axis just represents all of the data you collected on a single day. In this case, all of the data were collected on the same day, so they form a single column.

Correction:
9:28 I have log(reads for gene X) - log(average for gene X), but it should be: log(reads for gene X) - average(log values for gene for gene X). We are subtracting the geometric mean from each gene measurement. In other words, if you take 'the average of reads' to be the geometric average, it all hangs neatly together.

Correction:
4:15 I say getting 7 oranges and 1 blue is just as rare a getting 7 blues and 1 red. This is incorrect, since there are more blues and oranges in general than there are blues and red. However, the idea that we add up rarer events is correct.

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

Papai Noel
He’s the surfing the waves
He’s got his speedo on, and he’s got his shades

He shaved his beard last week
‘Cause it’s just too warm
This is the mid-summer heat
Not a midwinter storm.

We got people singing Noite Feliz
We just finished plugging in our electrical tree

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

When he’s not hanging dez
Papai’s in Greenland
Fezzik’s employed making
presents by hand

Check out the presépio
It’s bad to the bone
You’ve got your amigo secreto
So you’re never alone

The missa do galo was crazy it lasted all night
Let’s eat a feijoada til we see the morning light

It’s Christmas time in Rio, 
While the sun shines down on Rio

I see the world the way I want to see the world from over here. 
Everything is clear. 
You see the world the way you want to see the world from over there. 
In your rocking chair. 

So we might fight 
All night 
But that’s alright with me. 

I ride a bike you drive a truck I shake my fist up in the air. 
To let you know I care 
You leave your trash out on the curb for weeks on end it makes me mad. 
I bet that makes you glad 

You stay up late I go to bed I hear the noise right through the wall. 
I give the cops a call. 
I’m up at 5 it’s time for work when the cops arrive and take me in. 
Oh not again! 

I get back home my fingers crossed but I’m not alone you’re still around. 
Sitting on the ground. 
We’ve tried to be apart but there’s nothing’s worse than a lonely heart I guess I see. 
You’re the one for me.

RNA-seq results often contain a PCA or MDS plot. This StatQuest explains how these graphs are generated, how to interpret them, and how to determine if the plot is informative or not.

In the previous tutorials we learned the basics of writing an AI agent within Starcraft 2, but we've not yet been able to defeat the enemy computer player. In order to do this, we're going to need to go on the offensive. There are many different types of units that we can go with to play more offensively, but my unit of choice is going to be the Void Ray. This is a good general purpose unit that flies around and shoots a laser beam.

I visited this topic some years ago, but quite a bit has changed, so I figured I would revisit it again. For those of you who are new to Starcraft 2 (SC2) or it's been a while, the game at a basic level is actually fairly easy to understand. In order to be highly competitive, lots of factors can indeed come into play, but if you're looking for a fun environment to try your programming and maybe even deep learning/reinforcement learning skills, this is a pretty good choice.

To begin, there are several types of objects in Carla. First, you of course have the ""world."" This is your environment. Then, you have the actors within this world. Actors are things like your car, the sensors on your car, pedestrians, and so on. Finally, we have blueprints. The blueprints are the attributes of our actors.

With this information, let's start writing some actual code. To begin, let's just make a car that spawns in and simply drives forward and then we want to see the information from a regular RGB camera that we'll place on the hood of the car.

Q-Learning is a model-free form of machine learning, in the sense that the AI ""agent"" does not need to know or have a model of the environment that it will be in. The same algorithm can be used across a variety of environments.

For a given environment, everything is broken down into ""states"" and ""actions."" The states are observations and samplings that we pull from the environment, and the actions are the choices the agent has made based on the observation. For the purposes of the rest of this tutorial, we'll use the context of our environment to exemplify how this works.

The field of data analytics is quite large and what you might be aiming to do with it is likely to never match up exactly to any tutorial. With that in mind, I think the best way for us to approach learning data analysis with Python is simply by example. My plan here is to find some datasets and do some of the common data analysis tasks, using the Pandas package, to hopefully get you familiar enough with the package to work with it on your own.

Until then, we really can develop everything easier by just hard-coding in our tests. Again, here we ""know"" when a winner has actually won (3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), but how can we define this in a program?

So far, we've found a way to drastically improve our rank just by making a slight modification to the starter code given to us. At this point, I notice there are a few issues. One issue is that my ships often ""forget"" their objective and give the impression that they're changing their minds. We need to remember our objectives beyond the single turn. Also, we noticed that the ends of matches had our ships often just sitting there idle, stacking up until the end of the match. We might as well use our ships to attack. Doing this means we can lower enemy numbers, but we can also over-take planets that our enemy owns and make them our own, furthering our chances of winning.

I am just going to throw my function in. It's not the best, and I am hoping someone comes up with something better. That said, while we wait for a savior, my code works in the following way:

First, find the main lines. Next, find the groups of lines that are similar to eachother (by comparing slope and bias), and save these as ""the same line."" Next, take the two most common lines, and assume these must be our lanes. After we've done ROI, the next most likely ""line"" just simply is almost certain to be the lanes. That's the hypothesis anyway!

One thought I had was that we could detect both lanes, and then attempt to orient the car in between the two lanes, so long as those two lanes had different slopes. 

...then I began to think about it, and wondered if the problem coudl be even more simple than that. I noticed that the times when the lanes would ""both"" be on one side or the other was when we were getting to close to one of the edges. 

So next I wondered, hmm, what if we just work with the following logic:

If one lane's slope is positive, and the other is negative, then we're fine, continue straight. 

If both lane's slopes are negative, then we're too far left, and we should turn right.

If both lane's slopes are posotive, then we're too far right, and we should turn left.

...surely it can't be that simple right?

There are many things to do in GTA V, but our first goal will be to create a self-driving car, well scooter in this case. 

The idea of using GTA V is that it is such a massive, open, sand-box type of environment that we can control, so it makes for a great development area. 

Using the methods we use here, you should be able to follow along with a different game as well, it's certainly not required that you use GTA V, but that's what I will be using.

The HC-SR04 distance sensor measures distance based on emitting a sound burst, and timing how long it takes to receive the echo back. Using the known constant that is the speed of sound, we can mathmematically determine the distance of any object in front of this sensor by simply measuring how much time passed while the sound waves were emitted, hit the object in front of the sensor, bounced back, and came back to the sensor.

Assuming you've got your board, and an SD card, you're ready to carry on. Being a full computer, the Raspberry Pi uses an Operating System. While you can run headless (from a command line, no desktop), you can also have a GUI desktop if you like. There are quite a few choices for Raspberry Pi operating systems, but most people choose Raspbian, which is a Debian-based operating system that is optimized specifically for the Raspberry pi. This operating system is also most likely to support other packages that you may already be familiar with from other Linux distributions, so it makes for a good starting OS.

In this series, we're going to be taking the ""next steps"" after one has become comfortable with the basics of Python, and has been working with it for a bit.

Up to this point, my tutorials have all been done using very basic, rudimentary Python. My definition of basic Python: code that is meant to ""just make it run."" This is fine for beginners, because there's not much point in overloading with nuances (most people wont retain it, since they don't care, at least I didn't when I was starting out).

I define intermediate Python code as:

Modular - Easily used by others and/or in other projects by you or others. Basically, write code with the intention to honor DRY (don't repeat yourself).
Maintainable - ...Both by the original author and by other users. Is it easily read-able and understood?
Scales - For this to happen, code needs to be efficient when it runs, and be able to scale. Think about reading files, working with requests, or doing calculations. Maintainability also plays a major role in scaling.
In general, code that meets the above standards in Python is done with the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. There does exist another paradigm, called Functional Programming (FP), and there are bloody wars fought over which is better. We're going to use OOP. Either one of these is better than outright scripting, which what most beginner programmers are really doing.

To begin this series, I am going to teach a few basic standard library functions and functionalities of Python that will replace otherwise bad habits in programming, before getting into Object Oriented Programming and design.

If you are going to realistically continue with deep learning, you're going to need to start using a GPU. While there exists demo data that, like the MNIST sample we used, you can successfully work with, it is not going to prepare you for many of the hardships that large datasets come with, and you wont be able to try out many of the more interesting examples of what neural networks are capable of.

Thus, in this tutorial, we're going to be covering the GPU version of TensorFlow. In order to use the GPU version of TensorFlow, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with a compute capability greater than 3.0. I had been using a couple GTX 980s, which had been relatively decent, but I was not able to create models to the size that I wanted so I have bought a GTX Titan X instead, which is much more enjoyable to work with, so pay close attention to VRAM on the card. 4 GB is what I had on my 980s, which gives you 8 GB total, but 4+4 in SLI is not the same as 8GB on one card, for example. You can use two cards at once, but this is not ideal. Buy the single best GPU that you can.

The MNIST dataset has the images, which we'll be working with as purely black and white, thresholded, images, of size 28 x 28, or 784 pixels total. Our features will be the pixel values for each pixel, thresholded. Either the pixel is ""blank"" (nothing there, a 0), or there is something there (1). Those are our features. We're going to attempt to just use this extremely rudimentary data, and predict the number we're looking at (a 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9). We're hoping that our neural network will somehow create an inner-model of the relationships between pixels, and be able to look at new examples of digits and predict them to a high degree.

In this tutorial, we are going to be covering some basics on what TensorFlow is, and how to begin using it.

Libraries like TensorFlow and Theano are not simply deep learning libraries, they are libraries *for* deep learning. They are actually just number-crunching libraries, much like Numpy is. The difference is, however, a package like TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency. We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs. But that's not all! We can even distribute computations across a distributed network of computers with TensorFlow. So, while TensorFlow is mainly being used with machine learning right now, it actually stands to have uses in other fields, since really it is just a massive array manipulation library.

What is a tensor? Up to this point in the machine learning series, we've been working mainly with vectors (numpy arrays), and a tensor can be a vector. Most simply, a tensor is an array-like object, and, as you've seen, an array can hold your matrix, your vector, and really even a scalar.

For setup, TensorFlow is supported by Mac and Linux, but not Windows. You can use their Docker distribution on Windows if you wanted.

You are free to use whatever setup you want, but I am personally going to be using Ubuntu 16.04, on a Virtual Machine, on my Windows machine. At the moment, it is still relatively unclear about what platform people will be executing their machine learning models on, so who knows what sort of operating system will become king in the end for this field. Feel free to use whatever method you want to use, it should not matter for a while, but I will still briefly run through the setup of the virtual machine.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,oYbVFhK_olY,Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow Introduction,"Welcome to a new section in our Machine Learning Tutorial series: Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow. The artificial neural network is a biologically-inspired methodology to conduct machine learning, intended to mimic your brain (a biological neural network).

The Artificial Neural Network, which I will now just refer to as a neural network, is not a new concept. The idea has been around since the 1940's, and has had a few ups and downs, most notably when compared against the Support Vector Machine (SVM). For example, the Neural Network was popularized up until the mid 90s when it was shown that the SVM, using a new-to-the-public (the technique itself was thought up long before it was actually put to use) technique, the ""Kernel Trick,"" was capable of working with non-linearly separable datasets. With this, the Support Vector Machine catapulted to the front again, leaving neural nets behind and mostly nothing interesting until about 2011, where Deep Neural Networks began to take hold and outperform the Support Vector Machine, using new techniques, huge dataset availability, and much more powerful computers.

There is some degree of randomness here, so your results may not be the same. You can probably re-run the program to get similar data if you don't get something similar, however.

We're going to take a look at the Titanic dataset via clustering with Mean Shift. What we're interested to know is whether or not Mean Shift will automatically separate passengers into groups or not. If so, it will be interesting to inspect the groups that are created. The first obvious curiosity will be the survival rates of the groups found, but, then, we will also poke into the attributes of these groups to see if we can understand why the Mean Shift algorithm decided on the specific groups.

The Mean Shift algorithm finds clusters on its own. For this reason, it is even more of an ""unsupervised"" machine learning algorithm than K-Means.

The way Mean Shift works is to go through each featureset (a datapoint on a graph), and proceed to do a hill climb operation. Hill Climbing is just as it sounds: The idea is to continually increase, or go up, until you cannot anymore. We don't have for sure just one local maximal value. We might have only one, or we might have ten. Our ""hill"" in this case will be the number of featuresets/datapoints within a given radius. The radius is also called a bandwidth, and the entire window is your Kernel. The more data within the window, the better. Once we can no longer take another step without decreasing the number of featuresets/datapoints within the radius, we take the mean of all data in that region and we have located a cluster center. We do this starting from each data point. Many data points will lead to the same cluster center, which should be expected, but it is also possible that other data points will take you to a completely separate cluster center.

In this tutorial, we're going to begin setting up or own SVM from scratch.

Before we dive in, however, I will draw your attention to a few other options for solving this constraint optimization problem:

First, the topic of constraint optimization is massive, and there is quite a bit of material on the subject. Even just our subsection: Convex Optimization, is massive. A starting place might be: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf. For a starting place for constraint optimization in general, you could also check out http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/Constrained-Opt.pdf

Within the realm of Python specifically, the CVXOPT package has various convex optimization methods available, one of which is the quadratic programming problem we have (found @ cvxopt.solvers.qp).

Also, even more specifically there is libsvm's Python interface, or the libsvm package in general. We are opting to not make use of any of these, as the optimization problem for the Support Vector Machine IS basically the entire SVM problem.

Now, to begin our SVM in Python.

There are various ways to compute distance on a plane, many of which you can use here, but the most accepted version is Euclidean Distance, named after Euclid, a famous mathematician who is popularly referred to as the father of Geometry, and he definitely wrote the book (The Elements) on it.

As processing improves and hardware architecture changes, the methodologies used for machine learning also change.

The objective of linear algebra is to calculate relationships of points in vector space. This is used for a variety of things, but one day, someone got the wild idea to do this with features of a dataset. We can too! Remember before when we defined the type of data that linear regression was going to work on was called ""continuous"" data? This is not so much due to what people just so happen to use linear regression for, it is due to the math that makes it up. Simple linear regression is used to find the best fit line of a dataset.

I remember the first time that I was trying to learn about machine learning, and most examples were only covering up to the training and testing part, totally skipping the prediction part. Of the tutorials that did the training, testing, and predicting part, I did not find a single one that explained saving the algorithm. With examples, data is generally pretty small overall, so the training, testing, and prediction process is relatively fast. In the real world, however, data is likely to be larger, and take much longer for processing. Since no one really talked about this important stage, I wanted to definitely include some information on processing time and saving your algorithm.

While our machine learning classifier takes a few seconds to train, there may be cases where it takes hours or even days to train a classifier. Imagine needing to do that every day you wanted to forecast prices, or whatever. This is not necessary, as we can just save the classifier using the Pickle module.

https://pythonprogramming.net/quadcopter-flight-and-legal-tutorial/

There are two major types of propellelers. Some are threaded, some arent. If your motor's shaft isn't threaded, then you cannot use the threaded propellers.

Threaded propellers are usually both the propeller and attachment system all in one. This is nice for quickly attaching and detatching the propellers, but it does not allow for you to balance the propeller. Almost no propellers come perfectly balanced, so you can safely assume the quick detatch ones are not perfect either. Despite this, I have had no issues personally with adjusting for differences in balance by modifying trim on the controller. If you can, then you can balance a propeller by adding tiny bits of tape to the underside of the propeller to add weight, and you use a propeller balancer.

All quadcopters break down to the following (I will link to specific parts further down, do not want to clutter things at this point):

Frame - This is what everything attaches to.

Motors - Things that spin

ESC - Electronic Speed Controllers, which dictate the speed at which your motors spin.

Propellers - Attaches to motor to be spun and generate down-force

Receiver (and transmitter) - Usually these come together. The transmitter is your ""remote controller"" and the receiver is what sits on the quadcopter to accept the incoming signal.

Flight Control Board - Receives signal from your receiver, which then feeds out to your ESCs. Most flight control boards also have some basic stability control that helps to keep your quadcopter balanced.

LiPo (Lithium Polymer) Battery - powers your quadcopter! Somewhere in the range of 1.3 - 2.2 amps.

Power distribution Board - Takes power in from your battery, powers the ESCs which then power your motors, and also powers the flight control board.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,FNQxxpM1yOs,Introduction - Django Web Development with Python 1,"Welcome to a Django web development with Python tutorial series. Django is a Python web development framework, aimed at rapid development and deployment.

One of the more common questions people have is ""which framework"" they should use. There are quite a few for Python, with Django and Flask being the two most popular.

Flask is more of what we call a ""micro"" web framework. It is much ""lower level"" than Django is. This allows for more customization and control for the developer.

Django is much more of a higher-level framework, and imposes a set structure on the developer.

Thus, with Flask you can create systems your way, which is probably not most efficient, fastest, or secure way. With Django, you are a bit more constrained, but you are going to most likely do it the best way possible. As with almost all questions people ask me regarding which to use, the answer is: Try a few, and choose the one you like best. In the end, Django and Flask can be used to make the exact same websites!

To try Django, you need to get Django first (you will also need Python installed). This is exceptionally simple:

pip install Django

From here, we grab the image, convert to grayscale, resize it, then save it. We use a simple counter for naming the images. Go ahead and run it. As you can probably see, there are a lot of missing pictures and such. That's okay. More problematic is some of these error pictures. Basically all white with some text that says they are no longer available, rather than serving and HTTP error. Now, we have a couple choices. We can just ignore this, or fix it. Hey, it's an image without a watch, so whatever right? Sure, you could take that opinion, but if you use this pulling method for positive then this is definitely a problem. You could manually delete them... or we can just use our new Image Analysis knowledge to detect these silly images and remove them!

I went ahead and made a new directory, calling it ""uglies."" Within that directory, I have click and dragged all ugly image versions (just one of each). There's only one major offender that I found with the negatives, so I just have one. Let's write a script to find all instances of this image and delete it.

In this tutorial, we'll be covering thresholding for image and video analysis. The idea of thresholding is to further-simplify visual data for analysis. First, you may convert to gray-scale, but then you have to consider that grayscale still has at least 255 values. What thresholding can do, at the most basic level, is convert everything to white or black, based on a threshold value. Let's say we want the threshold to be 125 (out of 255), then everything that was 125 and under would be converted to 0, or black, and everything above 125 would be converted to 255, or white. If you convert to grayscale as you normally will, you will get white and black. If you do not convert to grayscale, you will get thresholded pictures, but there will be color.

While that sounds good enough, it often isn't. We will be covering multiple examples and different types of thresholding here to illustrate this.

We've come quite a long ways here, and the next, and final, macro step that we want to take here involves looking into economic indicators to see their impact on housing prices, or the HPI.

Text based version of this tutorial and sample code: http://pythonprogramming.net/economic-factors-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/

There are two major economic indicators that come to mind out the gate: S&P 500 index (stock market) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product). I suspect the S&P 500 to be more correlated than the GDP, but the GDP is usually a better overall economic indicator, so I may be wrong. Another macro indicator that I suspect might have value here is the unemployment rate. If you're unemployed, you're probably not getting that mortgage. We'll see though. We've been through the process for adding more data points, so I do not see much point in dragging you all through this process. There will be one new thing to note, however. In the HPI_Benchmark() function, we're changing the ""United States"" column to be US_HPI. This makes a bit more sense when we're bringing in other values now.

For GDP, I couldn't find one that encompassed the full time frame. I am sure you can find a dataset, somewhere, with this data, maybe even on Quandl. Sometimes you have to do some digging. I also had trouble finding a nice long-term monthly unemployment rate. I did find an unemployment level, but we really want more of a percentage/rate, otherwise we need to divide the unemployment level by the population. We could do that if we decide unemployment rate is worth having, but we'll work with what we get first.

At its core, it is very much like operating a headless version of a spreadsheet, like Excel. Most of the datasets you work with will be what are called dataframes. You may be familiar with this term already, it is used across other languages, but, if not, a dataframe is most often just like a spreadsheet. Columns and rows, that's all there is to it!

There are two major ways to handle for subplots, which are used to create multiple charts on the same figure. For now, we'll start with a clean slate of code. If you're following along linearly, then make sure to keep the old code on hand, or you can always revisit the previous tutorial for the code again.

There are many types of files, and many ways you may extract data from a file to graph it. Here, we'll show a couple of ways one might do this. First, we'll use the built-in csv module to load CSV files, then we'll show how to utilize NumPy, which is a third-party module, to load files.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,ZyTO4SwhSeE,Matplotlib Tutorial 3   bar charts and histograms,"The plt.bar creates the bar chart for us. If you do not explicitly choose a color, then, despite doing multiple plots, all bars will look the same. This gives us a change to cover a new Matplotlib customization option, however. You can use color to color just about any kind of plot, using colors like g for green, b for blue, r for red, and so on. You can also use hex color codes, like #191970

Next, we can cover histograms. Very much like a bar chart, histograms tend to show distribution by grouping segments together. Examples of this might be age groups, or scores on a test. Rather than showing every single age a group might be, maybe you just show people from 20-25, 25-30... and so on.

With Matplotlib, we have styles which serve a very similar purpose to Matplotlib graphs as CSS (cascading style sheet) pages serve for HTML. As you can see up to this point, all of these changes we're making to our graphs start to add up, and we only have one axis so far! We could use for loops to at least keep the amount of code down, but we can also make use of these styles with Matplotlib.

The idea of a style page is to write your customization to a style file, and then, to use those changes and apply them to your graph, all you do is import style and then use that specific style. This way, let's say you are finding yourself always changing various elements of your graphs. Instead of having to write 25-200 lines of customization code per chart, you can just write it once to a style, and then load in that style and apply all of those changes in two lines!

While people like to see historical prices in their live graphs, they also want to see the most recent price. What most applications do, is the annotate the last price at the y-axis height of the price, and then kind of highlight it and move it around a bit in a box of sorts as price changes.

What is going on welcome to a python for finance tutorial video.

Just to clarify right out of the gate, a lot of people envision programming as being used solely for high frequency trading, since computers can execute trades faster than people.

While that is true, and computers are used for High Frequency Trading (HFT), they are also used for a whole lot more in finance. We're going to show the use of programming for things like simple algorithmic trades like moving average crossovers, all the way to utilizing things like machine learning. 

Computers can be used for really anything from high frequency trading to long term investing. 

Computers allow you to test all of your ideas through what is called back-testing.

Back testing is where we take our trading strategies and apply them to historical data to see how they would have done if we had employed them.

Back testing comes with some inherent flaws. First off, the usual warning about historical results are not indicative of future ones, and back testing also tends to ignore things like execution time, or how long it takes to actually make a trade. Depending on execution time and the order size, you're almost certainly to experience what is called skid / slippage. Skid/slip is the change in price during an order, from the point of execution initialization to when you actually complete the order.

All that said, back testing is still a must, and you will find as we go through this series that back testing can become a reliable method for looking into the future, and we can also add risk metrics on top of it.

So, this series is going to go through automated trading with python for finance.

It would be helpful to have at least some background in Python, though I will do my best to make it not necessary. I will explain the code each step of the way, and, should you have any questions or confusions, I am always happy to help.

So let's get started. To do this series, we're going to build everything on top
of a service called Quantopian. Quantopian is a web app that allows us to write pure
python code, it's not a rendition of python, it is python, in their web based IDE, which is the editor we write code into.

They have a ton of batteries included so to speak, which means they have a lot of the modules that we're going to be using. Modules are pre-written code that we can import and use so we don't have to write a hundred thousand lines of code to do machine learning, for example.

For the newcomer to Python, modules can be a bit of a pain to acquire. Using Quantopian eliminates this pain completely.

We also want to use Quantopian because their back-testing simulation is very noob friendly. Quantopian is built on top of python, a bunch of other modules, and a module called Zipline, which is a back-testing module for Python. Zipline can be used outside of Quantopian, so you can learn with Quantopian and then protect your algorithm if you wanted to by moving off their website, but, for now, it will make things extremely simple.

Quantopian also has a ton of high quality data that we can use. Normally, you will need to go and acquire this data somehow. There are some really great data resources out there, but Quantopian makes this super easy too.

The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

This time, we're using a movie reviews data set that contains much shorter movie reviews. 

You can get this data set from: http://pythonprogramming.net/static/downloads/short_reviews/

This one yields us a far more reliable reading across the board, and is far more fitting for the tweets we intend to read from the Twitter API soon.

Turns out, doing this is super easy. NLTK has considered this in advance, allowing us to inherit from their ClassifierI class from nltk.classify, which will give us the attributes of a classifier, yet allow us to write our own custom classifier code.

A module that is focused on machine learning is scikit-learn, which is packed with a large array of machine learning algorithms which are optimized in C. 

Luckily NLTK has recognized this and comes packaged with a special classifier that wraps around scikit learn. In NLTK, this is: nltk.classify.scikitlearn, specifically the class:  SklearnClassifier is what we're interested in.

This allows us to port over any of the scikit-learn classifiers that are compatible, which is most.

Examples of this might be loading a massive dataset into memory, some basic pre-processing of a static dataset, or, like in our case, the training of a classifier. 

In our case, we spend much time on training our classifier, and soon we may add more. It is a wise choice to go ahead and pickle the trained classifer. This way, we can load in the trained classifier in a matter of milliseconds, rather than waiting 3-5+ minutes for the classifier to be trained. 

To do this, we use the standard library's ""pickle"" module. What pickle does is serialize, or de-serialize, python objects. This could be lists, dictionaries, or even things like our trained classifier!

These descriptions are called ""features"" in machine learning. For our project, we're just going to simply classify each word within a positive or negative review as a ""feature"" of that review. 

Then, as we go on, we can train a classifier by showing it all of the features of positive and negative reviews (all the words), and let it try to figure out the more meaningful differences between a positive review and a negative review, by simply looking for common negative review words and common positive review words.

So, your root stem, meaning the word you end up with, is not something you can just look up in a dictionary.

A root lemma, on the other hand, is a real word. Many times, you will wind up with a very similar word, but sometimes, you will wind up with a completely different word.

This is the process where we remove word affixes from the end of words. 

The reason we would do this is so that we do not need to store the meaning of every single tense of a word. For example:

Reader
Reading
Read

Aside from tense, and even one of these is a noun, they all have the same meaning for their ""root"" stem (read).

This way, we store one single value for the root stem of ""read."" Then, when we wish to learn more, we can look into the affixes that were on the end, like ""ing"" is an active word, or in the past, then you have reader as someone who reads... then just plain read as either past tense or current.

This is the methodology used to ""clean up"" and prepare your data for analysis. 

One of the first steps to pre-processing is to utilize stop-words. Stop words are words that you want to filter out of any analysis. These are words that carry no meaning, or carry conflicting meanings that you simply do not want to deal with. 

The NLTK module comes with a set of stop words for many language pre-packaged, but you can also easily append more to this list.

Tkinter is a Python wrapper about Tcl, which is a graphical user interface development toolkit. 

In this video, we introduce the topic and our goals. Here, we're going to make a Bitcoin trading application as an example. This application will have multiple pages, live graphs, trade execution, and more. You will not need bitcoin or a bitcoin account to do this tutorial.

Just make sure you have a 32x32 image, or something close, or you will have some distortion.

For this tutorial, we’re going to use Highcharts. I’ve used these for a few years now, and I have been very happy with them. They are still in active development as well.

Hello and welcome to my introduction to Flask. Flask is a web framework for the Python programming language. A lot of people are curious to know what the differences of Flask and other developmental frameworks, especially compared to the Python frameworks. 

In this video, we cover what Flask is and how it compares to other frameworks, then we talk about how we set up our development server. We are going to be using a real server here for development, not a local setup. 

We do this because, if you are trying to learn web development, then you must be interested in a live, real website. The problem with working on a local instance is then you have to transfer everything to an actual server. You will find very quickly that things work very different when you leave your home computer. 

Hosts that I recommend:

digitalocean.com: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d1c4c6e66979  (use these guys if you want just a small, cheap server $5/mo)

linode.com: https://www.linode.com/?r=b417bc672ff52d6c055fd7a56e024939c667b0fd (use these guys if you think your website will get more than 1k visitors a day, I prefer Linode to DO.)

pythonanywhere.com (use these guys for super easy setup, not recommended, however, for their downtimes, and some access restrictions as compared to your typical server.)

Matplotlib is a popular and robust Python module that allows programmers to create graphs and charts from their data. Pandas makes loading your data into Matplotlib slightly easier, as well as handles almost all of the processing necessary to get it ready for Matplotlib. Pandas is basically created to do this in the most efficient way possible. Pandas is also quite remarkably good at working with data with dates and Matplotlib. Traditionally, working with data that is indexed by date is somewhat challenging with Matplotlib, but not when using Pandas!

In this video we exhibit our basic autonomous raspberry pi robot car. All of the car's wheel movements are random, and the only change to the random-ness is when the front ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) detects that an object is too close. When this occurs, the robot car automatically will reverse.

We programmed in a failsafe as well that if reverse does not work, a pivot will be attempted, more reversing, and, if all else fails, shutdown. Worked better than expected, so that's nice.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,Bu0kpU-ozaw,How to use IBPy Python with Interactive Brokers TWS API For Automated Trading,"This tutorial covers how to use the IBPy Python programming module with Interactive Broker's Trader Workstation API (TWS API). We assume that Python is already installed on your machine. If not, head over to: https://www.python.org/download/ and download Python 2.7!

The API is intended for Java, though the IBPy module is a Python wrapper around the Java API which allows us to use Python. 

This tutorial will teach you how to actually execute an order through the TWS API. We cover installation of IBPy as well as TWS. We also show what settings you need to modify in TWS to allow for automated trading. From here, we cover how to execute both a market order for stocks as well as a limit order. 

I hope you enjoy, if you have any questions or comments, please leave them below, thanks!

In this case, we use Tkinter to log key input from the user. This is notably not the most efficient way to do it, so, if you feel you have a better way, feel free. It'd be nice to control it via the shell, but that cannot work when using Tkinter. 

Since this isn't my main end-goal, I am not too focused on solving this one via python, but feel free to share if you know a better way via python.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,UKXx4e9PotI,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Installing modules,"At this point, you've got all the basics necessary to start employing modules.

We still have to teach classes, among a few other necessary basics, but now would be a good time to talk about modules.

IF you are using linux, installing Python modules is incredibly stupid easy. For programming, linux is just lovely when it comes to installing packages for just about whatever. I believe mac allows similar treatment, though I've not done it myself.

When I was first starting out with Python, installing modules was one of the most difficult things, for a few reasons. Mainly, with windows, there are quite a few methods for installation of modules. you've got pip install setuptools, download and click'n'drag, or setup.py

At the time of starting Python, a large part of my troubles was that I didn't actually understand the process of getting a module, and this is obviously very frustrating.

Python is going to look in a few places for modules.

That's going to be site-packages and the script's directory for the most part. There are some other places you can use, but let's leave them out of it. Knowing this allows you yourself to make your own modules, in the form of just a script if you want, putting that in the same directory as your main script, and then using import to bring it on board, you can also place multiple scripts in a dir and use that. Once you begin to familiarize yourself with this, and understand how and why things work, it will help you a lot.

This tutorial is going to be covering the basics of classes in python. For the most part, I just want you to just understand how to read and understand a class' workings. You can think of classes as groupings of functions, usually. Classes quickly work their way into ""intermediate"" programming, so hopefully I can just help you understand how they work and how to follow code that uses them.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,r9LtArXOYjk,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Global and Local Variables,"Welcome to another python 3 basics video, in this video we're going to now discuss the concept of global and local variables.

When users begin using functions, they can quickly become confused when it comes to global and local variables... getting a the dreaded variable is not defined even when they clearly see that it is... or so they think.

These terms of global and local correspond to a variable's reach within a script or program. A global variable is one that can be accessed anywhere. A local variable is the opposite, it can only be accessed within its frame. The difference is that global variables can be accessed locally, but not modified locally inherently.

A local variable cannot be accessed globally, inherently. Now, dont worry about committing that to memory right now, I think it makes a lot more sense when you just see and do it, so let's do that.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,KeRxe9rll2Q,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Function Parameter Defaults,"In the last tutorial, we explained what function parameters were, and that we could have an infinite amount of them. With this, we explained how having a lot of them could become troublesome and tedious for the programmer using the function. Luckily, there is a solution for this. Sometimes, it can make a lot of sense to make a complex function highly customize-able. That said, some people may want to use the function in it's simple... ""default"" ... form. Think about it like buying a car. Some people want to just buy the base model, with all the features that come by default from the factory. Other people want to customize their car in many different ways. Luckily, we allow people who want to customize their car the option to do it, but we do not ask every buyer of every car what kind of wheels they want, what brand of tire, what screws they want, what kind of leather seats by what brand, what windshield, what steering wheel, what lights... etc. This is just too much for some people and what they want to use the car for. Same goes for functions in programming.

So we have function parameter defaults, which allow the function's creator to set ""default"" values to the function parameters. This allows anyone to use a function with the default values, yet lets anyone who wishes to customize them the ability to specify different values.

When using defaults, any parameters with defaults should be the last ones listed in the function's parameters.

You can think of it a lot like why you choose to write and save a program, rather than writing out the entire program every time you want to execute it.

To begin a function, the keyword 'def' is used to notify python of the impending function definition, which is what def stands for. From there, you type out the name you want to call your function. It is important to choose a unique name, and also one that wont conflict with any other functions you might be using. For example, you wouldn't want to go calling your function print.

UCfzlCWGWYyIQ0aLC5w48gBQ,sentdex,jeVZP5vgEC4,Monte Carlo Simulation and Python 4 - Plotting with Matplotlib,"Monte Carlo Simulation with Python Playlist: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M_KPXwnrlE&feature=share&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdhOnp-FnVStDsALpYk2hk0

In this video, we cover some of the basics of using Matplotlib to chart our Monte Carlo generation results.

In the monte carlo simulation with Python series, we test various betting strategies. A simple 50/50 strategy, a martingale strategy, and the d'alembert strategy. We use the monte carlo simulator to calculate possible paths, as well as to calculate preferred variables to use including wager size, how many wagers, and more. 

There are many purposes for a monte carlo simulator. Some people use them as a form of brute force to solve complex mathematical equations. A popular example used is to have a monte carlo simulator solve for pi. In our case, we are using the Monte Carlo simulator to account for randomness and the degree of risk associated with a betting strategy. In the world of stock trading and investing, people can use the Monte Carlo simulator to test a given strategy's risk. 

It used to be very much the case that only performance was considered, for the most part, to decide on a trader's value. Only until recently has the paradigm shifted to consider a strategy's risk more closely. Through this series, you will be able to see just how much random variability can affect the outcome, regardless of how ""good"" or ""bad"" a strategy might have been.

Build a GPT from scratch, by Andrej Karpathy
https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY

If you want a conceptual understanding of language models from the ground up, @vcubingx just started a short series of videos on the topic:
https://youtu.be/1il-s4mgNdI?si=XaVxj6bsdy3VkgEX

If you're interested in the herculean task of interpreting what these large networks might actually be doing, the Transformer Circuits posts by Anthropic are great. In particular, it was only after reading one of these that I started thinking of the combination of the value and output matrices as being a combined low-rank map from the embedding space to itself, which, at least in my mind, made things much clearer than other sources.

Much of this video is based on the following Feynmann lecture
https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_31.html

The explanation for why the phase of a wave produced by a plane of oscillating charges is a quarter phase behind the wave of a charge in the center of that plane, and hence a quarter phase behind that of a light wave inducing the oscillations, is given in the previous chapter:

Veritasium video on FFTs
https://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo

A small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.

Another small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning ""the number of operations needed scales with N^2"". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.

The book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:
https://amzn.to/3aBrEzg

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27345/likelihood-ratio-vs-bayes-factor

Timetable:
0:00 - What is the paradox?
5:53 - The Bayes factor
11:00 - The snazzy Bayes rule
14:42 - Contrast with the usual formula

Thanks to everyone who endured me probing them with this puzzle and provided helpful discussion, especially Cam Christensen, Matt Parker, and Mike Sklar.  Mike, by the way, deserves credit for coming up with the particularly clean way to see that it's impossible when n is not a power of 2.

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Mistakes:
At 1:06:20, when changing r to equal 0.69*i, I said ""this is what we might think of as (2i)^x"", but that is not correct.  It's what we'd think of as [Exp(ln(2)*i)]^x for whatever complex number Exp(ln(2)*i) is.

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Not on the ""homework"" to show that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y). This gets a little more intricate if you start asking seriously about whether the series really converge, what they converge to, and how exactly you define a product with infinitely many terms. For anyone curious about the technical details, what you would want to show is that the Cauchy Product of the series for exp(x) and exp(y) converges to the product of the values exp(x) and exp(y) for any particular x and y. That requires the Merten's Theorem.

Errors:
- On the first sketch of a complex plane, there is a ""2i"" written instead of ""-2i"".
- At the end, in writing the angle sum identity, the last term should be sin(beta) instead of sin(alpha).
- During Q9, the terms in parentheses should include an i, (1/2 + sqrt(3)/2 i)

Curious about measure theory?  This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always-great Terence Tao.
https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/gsm-126-tao5-measure-book.pdf

Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.

Code for this video:
https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2020/sir.py

Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc

Data source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina

Some have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other.  Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.

While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I

Also, if you haven't heard of Ulam Spirals, you may enjoy this Numberphile video:
https://youtu.be/iFuR97YcSLM

Dirichlet's paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1408.pdf

Timestamps:
0:00 - The spiral mystery
3:35 - Non-prime spirals
6:10 - Residue classes
7:20 - Why the galactic spirals
9:30 - Euler’s totient function
10:28 - The larger scale
14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

And yet another from the blog Better Explained:
https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.

Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.

Evidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):
https://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0
You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.

The first proof goes back to Greek times, due to Archimedes, who was charmed by the fact that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of a cylinder encompassing it, and 2/3 the surface area as well (if you consider the caps).  Check out this video for another beautiful animation of that first proof:

Thanks to Dan Walsh for many great ideas, and thanks to Mike Hansen for many helpful conversations.

Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.

And while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do.  Really, the velocity scales of eddies decrease for lower length scales.

Writing and animations by Sridhar Ramesh, with editing and narration by Grant Sanderson.

Even though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this.  For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.  We will perhaps discuss this more in a follow-on video!

Some of you may be concerned about the final step here where we said the circle approaches a line.  What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

More on Doppler radar:
Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808

There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  

This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.

This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.

I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!

*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.

What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.

Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.

Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average.  This depends on the thing being attempted.  If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.  Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?

Note, to illustrate my point for the target audience of a new calculus student, I discussed a hypothetical speedometer that makes distance measurements over a very small time.  Interestingly, most actual speedometers in modern cars work by analyzing the induced current of a spinning magnet, which is in some sense the universe implementing the derivative.

And by Affirm: https://www.affirm.com/careers
Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/

One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).

The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose ""Hausdorff dimension"" is greater than its ""topological dimension"".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  

Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.

See Mandelbrot's book ""The Fractal Geometry of Nature"" for the full details and more examples.

Also, in a different video ""What does it feel like to invent math"", I give a completely different example of how adding up growing positive numbers can meaningfully give a negative number, so long as you loosen your understanding of what distance should mean for numbers: https://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU

Interestingly, that vertical line where the convergent portion of the function appears to abruptly stop corresponds to numbers whose real part is Euler's constant, ~0.577.  For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.

For anyone who wants to understand the cross-product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.  This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation.

Minor error at 1:44, the third line of the matrix should read ""v1 * w2 - w1 * v2""

*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

Dot products are a nice geometric tool for understanding projection.  But now that we know about linear transformations, we can get a deeper feel for what's going on with the dot product, and the connection between its numerical computation and its geometric interpretation.

The enigmatic equation e^{pi i} = -1 is usually explained using Taylor's formula during a calculus class.  This video offers a different perspective, which involves thinking about numbers as actions, and about e^x as something which turns one action into another.

The AI community is currently very dependent on Nvidia both for their hardware and for their software, to build, train, and test AI algorithms. Intel let's you do all of that on a CPU, which means its cheaper and it's end-to-end. GPUs are not good at exploratory data analysis or data ingestions. In this video, i'll use Intel's Developer Cloud to run Stable Diffusion on a 4th generation Xeon processor, no GPUs necessary, so you can see how it all works and try it out yourself, enjoy!

This keeps conversations private, free, & data compliant (both GDPR & HIPAA). In this video tutorial, i'll show you exactly how I did this for my ongoing healthcare project titled Doctor Dignity (previously titled DoctorGPT) so that you can do the same thing for any AI model, particularly Large Language Models. We start by building a simple language model in Python that runs on an Intel CPU, then accelerate it using CUDA for Nvidia GPUs, Metal for iOS GPUs, Vulkan for Android GPUs, and finally the Tensor Virtual Machine for both iOS and Android. We have a lot to GPU Programming cover in this video, comparing and contrasting different GPU programming techniques (computation vs allocation, abstraction vs transformation, stochastic optimization vs gradient based optimization). My next goal is to get a 3 billion parameter model to pass the US Medical Licensing exam and run on mobile devices. Don't worry if you're a beginner to all this, just sit back relax and enjoy the ride, I tried to make this as accessible as possible to all developers.

AI Religion is an emerging industry as large language models like ChatGPT gain sentience, we can turn them into distinct personalities, like Jesus, Buddha, and Krishna through directed prompting. I like to call this field ""Computational Theology"". A positive vision for Artificial General Intelligence is one that sees AGI as benevolent as the God's that humanity has worshipped for 1000s of years. Let's all rejoice in how AI enables spirituality, personal growth, and religious community at a time when so much of the news around AI has been fear based.

In this 5 minute video, we'll build a simple version of ChatGPT in under 40 lines of Python code to better understand it! Our version of ChatGPT will be called ElonGPT, trained to act just like Elon Musk, so that I can ask him if he will give me a free ride to Mars! ChatGPT was built in 3 steps, generative pre-training to learn English, supervised fine-tuning to learn dialogue, and reinforcement learning from human feedback to improve its dialogue capability. We'll go through each, step by step. The code that i use in the video is below!

First, a disclaimer - Do NOT invest any money in any type of sports betting bot or algorithmic engine that you are not willing to lose. I gave this sports betting bot money because I was willing to lose money to make a great video for my AI Wizards out there. To be exact, it was $1915.73 after transaction & conversion fees, which it used to bet on NBA teams that it predicted to win. Each week i'm learning more on how to optimally prompt ChatGPT to help me build MVPs, and it's a skill i'd like us all to learn, which is why i made this video. The tools used in this tutorial are the The Odds API for live sports data, Python for Programming, the Twitter API for Sentiment Analysis, PyTorch for Deep Learning, and Vercel for live deployment.

In this tutorial, I explain how to build the shoe hardware using about $10 in equipment, then how to program the shoe to mine bitcoin. We need more miners for the Bitcoin network that power their internet computers using renewable energy! This helps make the network more decentralized and secure without harming the planet. For example, some Bitcoin miners power their computers on top of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion rigs located in isolated areas, with no need for billion dollar wires to route the energy back to land. Others will someday build a giant solar satellite to capture the total energy output of the Sun, embed it with Bitcoin Mining computers, and transmit that monetary energy back to Earth over Satellite Internet. I challenge you to build your own Bitcoin Miner that uses renewable energy! #BitcoinMiningChallenge

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,yD3BMT_cXew,Building a Health DAO with GitHub CoPilot (AlphaCare: Episode 5),"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are the future of the Web. In this episode, we'll build a simple DAO that let's users submit their health data to a marketplace and let's health organizations buy that data, with the proceeds going directly to users. This is an idea I've been toying with for a few weeks as I'm really interested in ways of incentivizing people to be healthy. We'll learn about how DAOs work, then we'll build a toy DAO example. I'll then show you how to build a DAO without coding, then we'll build the Health DAO using Solidity, Truffle, Metamask, Ganache, IPFS, and Javascript. Interspersed in all of this are demos of GitHub's CoPilot tool that I now have access to, which auto-completes your code in an incredible way. Get hype!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,XOCuQAKhsMw,Mint a Genome NFT  (AlphaCare: Episode 4),"Health data is among the most valuable types of data, and using blockchain technology, patients can earn a passive income from sharing it with researchers and clinics. In this episode, I'll show you how I minted an NFT (Non-fungible token) of my genome that I sequenced from AncestryDNA. I used the Polygon and Ethereum blockchains to do this, and it's currently listed for sale on the OpenSea marketplace. NFTs are just getting started, they enable property rights for the meta-verse by artificially inducing scarcity on an otherwise infinitely replicable resource; data. We are just at the beginning of the NFT revolution and we have a lot to discuss in this video including how Ethereum, Polygon, and Genomic visualization works. Get ready for Python, Javascript, and Solidity programming. Enjoy!

In order to celebrate, lets see if we can install a bitcoin mining client onto my Tesla’s hardware. I don’t know if this is actually possible, but it’s worth it for the educational aspect. Tesla’s are computers on wheels, think of them like you would any other personal computer, except this one is attached to an electric drive train. The vision I have is that someday I can let my Tesla act as a fully autonomous robo-taxi that'll also be earning bitcoin the whole time! It will use its earnings, from both transportation services and bitcoin mining services to pay for its own expenses (repairs, electricity costs, and upgrades) as well as invest them into a diversified portfolio of emerging crypto-community networks. In this episode of my weekly live stream, we’re going to learn a lot about how Bitcoin works, how to install a Bitcoin mining client, and how to create an autonomous trading bot on that same hardware. 3 Wizards will each win $50 BTC for answering my 3 questions related to Bitcoin. Start studying Bitcoin’s functionality and I’ll see you then!

I'm going to strap a GoPro to myself as i snowboard to record training data. Then, we're going to use the latest version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect other snowboarders automatically. We'll look at the history of Object Detection and algorithms, then come to interesting conclusions about what makes the latest version of YOLO unique. Using the bounding boxes will help me improve my own ability to navigate and analyze different snowboarding techniques effectively. AI tech is amazing, but let's talk less about it and just build it for our own day to day uses. I'm going to ask you 3 questions about Object Detection, so i'm going to need you to start studying from my list of curated learning resources below. 3 Data Wizards will win $50 in BTC each this week, everyone on Earth is eligible, get hype!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,i4XvlM_j3A0,Let's Hack my Tesla with Javascript LIVE,"I just bought a Tesla Model 3 with Filecoin because my life is essentially the show ""Silicon Valley"", no matter where i live. It's the only car I've ever really wanted & the only car i would actually read the owner's manual for (i finished all 230+ pages on day 1). We have to hack this into this thing and build a useful machine learning app ourselves :D. Teslas are better thought of as robots than normal cars. They are computers on wheels, and the (unofficial) Tesla API gives us access to lots of streaming data. We're going to build a NodeJS web app that uses reinforcement learning (OpenAI Gym) + the Tesla API (TeslaJS) + real-time climate data (Weather API) to build our own version of real-time predictive temperature control. Think of this as an energy optimization problem. 

This week there will be 3 winners.  I will chose 3 people who answered 3/3 questions correctly to each receive $175 in BTC/ETH/USDC. Everyone on earth is eligible.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,KJIJ_tgpwR4,Let's Build Machine Learning...in RUST? LIVE,"Rust is a programming language that has been voted as the 'most loved programming language' in the Stack Overflow Developer survey every year since 2016. So what's the big deal about Rust? Well, it's quite a performant language because of how it uniquely and cleverly deals with memory management + type safety. Rust is being used in critical production applications where those features matter a lot, and more developers are beginning to take notice. In this episode of my weekly gameshow, we're going to build a tiny Rust library that does some basic data pre-processing and build a regression model as well. We'll then benchmark our code vs Python and see if we can see any performance gains. I'll need your help as I code to interactively answer a few math and multiple choice questions. One Data Wizard gets $500 cash and a dedicated freestyle rap at the end. Start studying Rust and let the games begin!

In this tutorial, I show you how I built my first game for the Oculus Virtual Reality platform in C# using Unity. Baton Master lets you practice conducting in a simulated orchestral environmental. I wanted to understand the process of encoding real-world knowledge into game mechanics. I recorded a 3 hour screencast of me rebuilding it from scratch but i condensed it as much as I could to focus on the most relevant parts for you. I'm also releasing the code so please use it as you need it to learn, build, and explore the incredible world of Virtual Reality. My favorite VR games are: Echo Arena, Beat Saber, Big Screen, The Under Presents, Pistol Whip, SuperHot, and of course Half Life: Alyx.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,x4b3Oiy868k,Tren Black - Siraj Raval Podcast #6,"Podcast #6 is with Tren Black. Tren is a tech youtuber and one of my more vocal critics. We talk about the pros & cons of online courses, Computer Science, our backgrounds, the youtube lifestyle, and he freestyle raps about data structures at the end. I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. 

The future of Education depends on all of us irreverently pushing the boundaries of what is perceived as normal by our peers. Education is not their word to define, it’s yours. We have to learn how to learn using the Internet, questioning every archaic tool that’s being used now, from the physical lecture hall to the proctored exam. Gamify your learning and don’t ever let anyone tell you that you can’t. Computer Science is my one true love, and I refuse to accept that all the ways it's being taught now are enough to educate the world. I want every man, woman, and child on this planet to have basic Computer Science literacy. Knowledge and action are inextricably connected, and the best way to prepare ourselves for the technological changes happening across every spectrum of our lives is with this knowledge. We have to completely reinvent Computer Science Education these next few years, and then the rest of Education will follow.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,EVoZMRmtBkY,Coronavirus Competition Results (Remdesivir),"I’m pleased to announce the results of our open-source Coronavirus Drug Discovery Competition! In just 2 weeks, hundreds of developers from around the world signed up to join the fight against the novel coronavirus, using publicly available datasets and algorithms to come up with relevant solutions. The top 3 submissions, winning $3500 in prizes, stood out from the rest in terms of their algorithmic and reporting quality. In this episode, I’m going to announce each of their backgrounds, as well as dive into the various machine learning techniques they used to predict a suitable treatment for Coronavirus. The top submission identified a compound called Remdesivir as the the most promising treatment for COVID-2019, due to its high scoring inhibitory potential when docked against the Coronavirus main Protease. Remdesivir was recently shown to be effective in treating the first US patient infected with COVID-2019, but is currently undergoing clinical trials to gain FDA approval. These findings help confirm it’s potential as an effective COVID-2019 treatment. I’ll explain more in the vid, Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,K5KDZLHsr1o,The Hardest Kaggle Challenge,"There's a new $20,000 challenge on Kaggle that uses a dataset titled ""The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus"". The aim of this episode is to get you up to speed as fast as possible so that you can participate. This challenge is hosted by Francois Chollet, the creator of the popular deep learning library Keras, and there are still 3 months to go. The goal is to create an algorithm that can learn the relationship between input-output pairs of colored tiles. Sounds simple at first, but upon closer inspection, creating an algorithm that's able to do so given such a small dataset requires genuine AI innovation. Deep Learning won't work because it requires big datasets and expensive compute, so even though this challenge is difficult, it's also the most accessible! We'll be learning about the dataset, related paper, and the various techniques that Kagglers have already attempted. Then, we'll learn about Neural Program Synthesis and future directions that could ultimately solve this problem. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,JhfNJlnN_Bg,DeepFake Chatbots,"Google just released a paper describing a chatbot titled ""Meena"", and they claimed that it's the most human-like chatbot ever created. That's a big claim! They demonstrated several conversations across a wide variety of topics in which Meena was able to skillfully joke, argue, and question a human in a realistic way. In this episode, we'll analyze Meena's architecture by comparing it to the previous generations of chatbots, then build our own 'DeepFake' chatbot using state of the art tools for text, audio, and video generation. I'm using the increasingly popular term DeepFake here because deep learning will increasingly be used to mimic/fake human personalities. These free, public tools are becoming incredibly powerful, and I hope this gives you a sense of what you can build today with modern language models. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,gAgZkdTF4KQ,CUDA Neural Networks,"CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture, and it’s the reason popular deep learning libraries like Tensorflow & PyTorch are considered “GPU-accelerated”.  CUDA is Nvidia’s programming platform that enables developers to leverage the full parallel processng capabilities of GPUs for deep learning applications. Almost all of the major deep learning libraries use CUDA under the hood, but it’s not really something that most developers think about often. In this episode, I’ll demo some progressively more complex CUDA examples by Nvidia to show you how using CUDA results in algorithmic speedups. We’ll use Nvidia’s profiler to clock speeds, then we’ll analyze a pure-CUDA neural network by Sergey Bugrov to understand how a full neural pipeline on the GPU looks like. Enjoy!

I wanted to see just how cheap a deep learning PC could be built for in 2020, so I did some research and put together a deep learning PC build containing brand new parts that comes out to about 450 US dollars. I chose NewEgg for the parts because it has a global shipping policy, deep learning belongs to the world not just the United States. In this episode, I’m going to walk you through what the deep learning stack looks like (CUDA, Jupyter, PyTorch, etc.) , why i chose the various hardware components, and then I’ll show you how to setup the full deep learning software stack on your PC.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,GQH-zWUylPY,AlphaFold Tutorial,"AlphaFold is DeepMind's newly released State of the Art AI system for Protein Folding prediction. I tried it out myself and was able to predict and visualize several protein shapes, so in this episode I'm going to show you step by step how to install and run it on your computer too! And of course explain how it all works along the way. AlphaFold has applications in Health, Sustainability, and Materials Design, and IMHO is the most promising application of AI yet. Protein Folding is a nontrivial problem that has been worked on for decades by billion dollar pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. For DeepMind (an incumbent) to enter into a protein folding competition out of nowhere and win 1st place by out-predicting all of them is a HUGE deal. I really hope that I can convey how amazing AlphaFold is to you and that you're able to test it out yourself. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,Y8mSngdQb9Q,Explainable Computer Vision with Grad-CAM,"Building powerful Computer Vision-based apps without deep expertise has become possible for more people due to easily accessible tools like Python, Colab, Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. But why does a computer classify an image the way that it does? This is a question that is critical when it comes to AI applied to diagnostics, driving, or any other form of critical decision making. In this episode, I'd like to raise awareness around one technique in particular that I found called ""Grad-Cam"" or Gradient Class Activation Mappings. It allows you to generate a heatmap that helps detail what your model thinks the most relevant features in an image are that cause it to make its predictions. I'll be explaining the math behind it and demoing a code sample by fairyonice to help you understand it. I hope that after this video, you'll be able to implement it in your own project. Enjoy!

One or more of the many slides i used to help convey concepts to people didn't include the name of the original source, the ""Fraunhofer institute"". This was not intentional, i literally forgot. I am one guy, and i'm making a sincere effort to invite more people into the AI community through educational videos while simultaneously crediting all the giant shoulders that my explanations stand on. I'll do better next week!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,rNG_hpSyZcE,The Reformer,"Google just released a new Neural Network architecture called ""The Reformer"" that helps make the state of the art in Natural Language Processing available to people with a smaller budget. They introduced two key ideas here, ""reversible layers"" and ""locality sensitive hashing"". Both of these concept build on about a decade of research in neural networks applied to NLP, so to truly understand the Reformer, we've got to understand the timeline of deep learning based NLP. In this episode, I'll take you on a journey through the advances that lead up to the Reformer, what the relevant applications of it are, and how you can get started building your own text application with it today in a few lines of Python code. All the code I demonstrate in this video is from various developers across GitHub, I do not claim any of it as my own, I am using them as examples to enable more people outside of Academia to understand modern NLP.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,ya3AdrfKYzc,Drug Engineering,"You can engineer a novel drug on your laptop today using Machine Learning thanks to an open-source contribution by a company called Insilico Medicine based in Hong Kong. I spent some time reading their paper, playing with their model, and learning about the history of drug discovery. I can very confidently say that we are about to enter into a new era of personalized, low-cost medicine. And this new era will not just be about treating diseases, it'll be about finding actual cures using primarily cell and gene therapies. I am actively working on figuring out how i can best contribute here, I want to join in on the fun :) In this episode i'm going to explain everything i've learned about this field and by the end I want you to start generating molecules on your machine.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,bA261BF0bdk,Graph Networks in 2020,"Graph Networks are extremely useful tools to help understand the graph data that's all around us. In this episode, I'm going to explain what some of the latest advancements in graph networks are and how you can leverage them to build your own graph network in a few lines of Python code. This space has matured so much that there is never a single library to discuss, there are always multiple competing options (which is a great thing). We'll be weighing the pros and cons of the Deep Graph, Graph Nets, and PyTorch Geometric library as well. I'm particularly interested in Graph Networks because of how well suited they are for interpreting the most complex biochemical factory that we know of - the human body. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,YW_fFBH6750,Reliable Machine Learning,"Deep learning classifiers make the ladies (and gentlemen) swoon, but they often classify novel data that's not in the training set incorrectly  with high confidence. This has serious real world consequences! In Medicine, this could mean misdiagnosing a patient. In autonomous vehicles, this could mean ignoring a stop sign. Machines are increasingly tasked with making life or death decisions like that, so it's important that we figure out how to correct this problem! I found a new, relatively obscure yet extremely fascinating paper out of Google Research that tackles this problem head on. In this episode, I'll explain the work of these researchers, we'll write some code, do some math, do some visualizations, and by the end I'll freestyle rap about AI and genomics. I had a lot of fun making this, so I hope you enjoy it!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,eN9Lb3vXsAw,AI in 2020,"Almost exactly 4 years ago I decided to dedicate my life to helping educate the world on Artificial Intelligence. There were hardly any resources designed for absolute beginners and the field was dominated by PhDs. In 2020, thanks to the extraordinary contributions of everyone in this community, all that has changed. It’s easier than ever before to enter into this field, even without an IT background. We’ve seen brave entrepreneurs figure out how to deploy this technology to save lives (medical imaging, automated diagnosis) and accelerate Science (AlphaFold). We’ve seen algorithmic advances (deepfakes) and ethical controversies (automated surveillance) that shocked the world. The AI field is now a global, cross-cultural movement that's not limited to academics alone. And that’s something all of us should be proud of, we’re all apart of this. I’ve packed a lot into this episode! I’ll give my annual lists of the best ML language and libraries to learn this year, how to learn ML in 2020, as well as 8 predictions about where this field is headed. I had a lot of fun making this, so I hope you enjoy it!

I thought it'd be useful to provide a frame for why I think biotech is an extremely interesting topic for developers (besides of course the promises of ending disease, hunger, waste, & climate change). If we live in a simulation, then Biology is inherently information based. And if that's the case, there's no limit on what we could create once we understand it's working principles.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,1zZZjaYl4AA,My Apology,"Doing high quality, original work is what ultimately pushes society forward and improves people's lives. If people started thinking that if they put something high quality and original on Github, a random youtuber would come along and claim it as their own work, then people might just start putting fewer things on GitHub to begin with, and the world would be a worse place. That's why its so critical to not plagiarize. The ideal world we want to live in is one where the people who actually do high quality & original work are the ones who get the credit. It took my reputation blowing up in my face for me to realize that, both in the Neural Qubit paper case & my content more generally. I hope my painful fall serves as a valuable lesson to everyone else. This is my apology video.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,0fCUxblwxpI,Healthcare & Reflections,"These past few weeks have been quite a learning experience and I'll be detailing everything here. I'm going to first share the work of 3 incredible entrepreneurs in Tanzania who are using AI to provide low-cost healthcare services to underserved people in their region. Then, I'm going to reflect on not just the Tanzania trip, but the past few weeks in general and what I've learned, including an apology. I feel so lucky to have gotten the chance to talk to these inspiring technologists, and I hope that they inspire you to create massive positive changes in your community too. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,__ByCy0PKKI,Machine Learning App Examples,"Machine Learning powers almost every internet service we use these days, but it's rare to find a full pipeline example of machine learning being deployed in a web app. In this episode, I'd like to present 5 full-stack machine learning demos submitted as midterm projects from the students of my current course. The midterm assignment was to create a paid machine learning web app, and after receiving countless incredible submissions, I've decided to share my favorite 5 publicly. I was surprised by how many students in the course had never coded before and to see them building a full-stack web app in a few weeks was a very fulfilling experience. Use these examples as a template to help you ideate on potential business ideas to make a positive impact in the world using machine learning. And if you'd like, be sure to reach out and support each of the students I've demoed here today in any way can you offer. They've been working their butts off. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,dGDlDH5CAPE,Quantum Supremacy,"Google claimed to achieve Quantum Supremacy in a research paper that was briefly leaked on a NASA website. The paper was taken down, but the Internet moves fast to recover data. In this episode, we'll discuss what quantum supremacy means, what the applications of quantum computing will be, and i'll explain how a quantum-resistant cryptographic technique called ""A New Hope"" works. Quantum Computing is my new love, I can't get enough of it. If you take a look at any QC research paper, you'll find a bunch of mat symbols and techniques that are not used in classical computing papers. It's confusing! But that's exactly why it's exciting, there's so much to learn. I hope you find this useful, enjoy!

In this episode, I'll explain 2 common types of attacks and 2 common types of defenses using various code demos from across the Web. There's some really dope mathematics involved with adversarial attacks, and it was a lot of fun reading about the 'cat and mouse' game between new attack techniques, followed by new defense techniques. I encourage anyone new to the field who finds this stuff interesting to learn more about it. I definitely plan to. Let's look into some math, code, and examples. Enjoy!

Artificial Intelligence is the most remarkable technology of our time, and it's starting to affect every single aspect of our lives. Despite it's massive impact, there is still so much misunderstanding about what it is, how it works, and what we can use it to do. In this series, I'll be traveling around the world to meet extraordinary individuals using AI to empower their communities. In each episode, I'll visit a different country to learn more about the intersection of their needs and the modern solutions that AI provides them. This is my pitch to Netflix, I'd love their help to bring AI awareness & inspiration to an even broader audience. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,BXw8vQXxvqc,How to Build a  Cybersecurity Startup,"I've built a demo app called DharmaSecurity, a fraud detection tool for businesses. The way it works is that once signed up, a business will paste a code snippet into their website, and then they'll get access to a dashboard that tells them how many fraudulent accounts they have. Our app will use machine learning to automatically remove suspected fraud accounts, and flag likely ones for review. To build this, I use a suite of AWS tools, python, javascript, a logistic regression model, a credit card fraud dataset, and a library called openmined to enable federated learning and secure multiparty computation. I've packed a lot into this video, animations, code, music, screencasts, skits, etc. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,BZ_sjvAHLpA,Generating Celebrity Voices & Music,"I've generated my own voice with AI! This is a relatively new technology and people have started generating not just celebrity voices, but entire musical pieces as well. The technology to generate sounds, both voices & music, has been rapidly improving the past few years thanks to deep learning. In this episode, I'll first demo some AI generated music. Then, i'll explain the physics of a waveform and how DeepMind used waveform-based data to generate some pretty realistic sounds in 2016. At the end, I'll describe the cutting edge of generative sound modeling, a paper released just 2 months ago called ""MelNet"". Enjoy! 

It would mean so much to me if you subscribe to my Youtube channel! https://bit.ly/2SvhG7v

Coding challenge! Replicate MelNet by Sept 1 2019, submit your github links in the comment section and i'll announce the winner shortly afterwards in a video. Check out this guy's partial code for a headstart:

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,p4DpQZfpzpE,Automatic Mathematics,"There are 7 math problems that each have a 1 million dollar prize attached to them by the Clay Mathematics Institute. Only 1 of these problems have been solved so far, meaning the other 6 are open to anyone in the world with the proper motivation to solve. In this episode, I'm going to explain how recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence can help an individual solve these problems and possibly win the prize money. There are 2 specific techniques I have in mind, the newly released ""Ramanujan Machine"" which can automatically generate conjectures, and the ""Neural Reasoning"" model by DeepMind. Both are relatively new papers, and I believe that we're beginning to see the building blocks of an entirely new frontier of mathematical discovery, where machines can help us discover mathematical principles in ways we couldn't alone. I'll explain it all here, enjoy! 

Spots are almost filled in my new Machine Learning course! Learn more here:

These are the daily habits that I practice to optimize my ability to learn and thus serve you better. I consider my body an input/output machine, so in order to optimize my output (educational content), I've got to optimize the input (my physical/mental health). My job is to educate the public on how relatively complex technologies work, and this requires me to learn a lot really fast. I've learned that large gains can be made in my ability to learn just my making small gains in a few different habits. The effects compound over time, that's how habits tend to work. You might not notice the effect of any one of these habits immediately, but put them all together and follow them with sustained enthusiasm. I promise you, eventually you're going to start seeing results. Try it for 30 days and see for yourself. Enjoy!

I've been waiting a long time to get a glimpse of the hardware, software, and intentions they have as they build this technology and the event was satisfying, thought provoking, and humbling. I'm going to review my impressions of the event, explain how the device works in technical detail, then make a few predictions of what it's going to be used for in the future. It's an exciting time to be alive, and although there are dangers involved, I have faith that we can learn from our mistakes and avoid having this tool be used for exploitation like social networks have been used for.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,jn-22XyKsgo,Automatic Machine Learning,"Automatic Machine Learning or ""AutoML"" is a field of Artificial Intelligence thats gaining a lot of interest lately. The idea is that doing any kind of task related to machine learning involves a whole lot of steps like cleaning a dataset, choosing a model, deciding what the right configurations of that model should be, deciding what the most relevant features are etc. The goal of AutoML is to automate all of that up to a point where all a data scientist would need to do is tell a machine to perform some task using a dataset and wait for it to learn how by itself. In this episode, i'm going to explain several popular AutoML techniques, then compare top AutoML frameworks like AutoKeras, Auto Sklearn, h20, Ludwig, etc. to help you decide which one will be the best for your needs.

I knew Brian years ago when Coinbase was a relatively humble startup and it's been mind blowing to see how far they've come in such a short period of time, managing the equivalent of billions of dollars in wealth in cryptocurrency. I admire Brian because he wakes up everyday determined to solve the 'meta-problem' of financial freedom using cryptocurrency, which he believes can indirectly alleviate poverty, increase entrepreneurship, and help reduce corruption in governments around the world. The President of the USA tweeted about Bitcoin and Facebook released it's ""Libra"" cryptocurrency, so it's an extremely exciting time in the space. I also ask him about his most ambitious ideas regarding the future of payments, and was pleasantly shocked by his answers. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,1lxHH1UBTBU,10 Books to Learn Machine Learning,"I've designed an ordered reading list of free books to help anyone learn machine learning efficiently! I'll explain why I chose each book and detail how it fits into the larger learning path. We'll start by learning about how the original learning algorithm (the human brain) works, then progressively move into more difficult technical subjects in machine learning. By the end, i'll have you learning about the cutting edge of machine learning (causal reasoning) and ideating as to how quantum machine learning will help drive the field forward. From beginner to doing cutting edge research in 10 books, enjoy!

This serves patients by giving them one place to store and view all of their health data across all providers globally. It serves providers by ensuring that health records are stored securely via a blockchain and allows them to see a patients previous health history easily. To build this app I used Node.js, Firebase, Bitcoin's Blockchain, Paypal, Stripe, Tesserect.js, BioBERT, and a health data visualization library called hFigures. The reason I built this app is to give you an idea on how a ""bitcoin"" startup would look practically, programmatically, and visually. I hope this inspires you to build something cool and even managed to fit a rap about SHA-256 into it. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,J9kbZ5I8gdM,How to Build a Biomedical Startup,"I've built an open source app called Dr Source, your personal medical question answering service! It uses a model called BioBERT trained on over 700K Q&As from PubMed, HealthTap, and other health related websites. I used Flutter to build an app around it and present it to you as a more thought out idea. I was excited by what I saw possible with BioBERT's output in Python notebooks, and thought a cleaner interface could absolutely make it a viable business. There are millions of people in this world without access to healthcare, and while this app isn't perfect, an automated diagnosis is better than no diagnosis. I urge you to use this code and video as a starting point in your journey to generate value for the world, and build wealth while doing so. Enjoy!

This app is called ""Macy"", your personal Yoga Instructor. It uses a machine learning model called PoseNet to detect human poses and overlay a skeleton stick figure on top. I retrained posenet on labeled Yoga poses images so it could detect when a person correctly performs a certain pose, then i used speech generation to have the Flutter app guide your actions from pose to pose, just as a real Yoga instructor would do. The goal is to help a user reduce stress, anxiety, and depression through a series of guide meditative poses. I've integrated a subscription service and some interesting design schemes, but the app isn't finished! There is still more to do. The point is to give you the starting template to start your own profitable business. Enjoy!

I wanted to meet the faces of our learning community in person, to see the work they were doing, and celebrate the collective future we’re all striving towards. So I searched for Castle’s in Europe on Airbnb, and found a villa in Spain! Then I invited some of our most active community organizers to come to Spain and live in the Villa for 3 days. I had no idea what to expect, but it turned out to be a life changing experience. In this video, you'll see exclusive footage from the event and interviews with the attendees. Hopefully this inspires you to start thinking about ways that you too can use AI to make a positive impact in the world. Enjoy!

In this video, I'll explain how a popular data science technique called sentiment analysis works using a real-world scenario. We'll play the role of a data scientist working at a startup making a personal healthcare device. Using sentiment analysis, we'll understand how consumers feel about a competitors product. That'll help us make decisions on how to promote our own product, and what feature we can focus on the most. Using Python, Twitter, and Google Colab, anyone can do this process in just a few minutes.

Lyrics:
School of AI 2019! Shoutout to my Wizards, this ones for you

It started with hello world hello engineers   
And now we’re , world-wide yo and this the premiere
So u gotta sit down tight and let me teach you a lesson
I call it intro to AI, this is my confession
Lesson one starts simple gotta get that data
Don’t even mess with the thetas until we get that data
And if we open the file, it might look like a haze,
But if we keep it algorithmic we can set it ablaze 
Hello!  Algebra ops its input times weight
Its a Matrix of nums, add a bias, activate
And when it learns from the data it’ll tell us things
Like how to cure a disease or how to spend our money
Or even, generate a game you won’t believe,
Its like build train test done, NLP
Damn! Bad drivers let me show you my friend
Cause you can drive it hands free and still have so much to spend

(repeat 2x) 
Make the Data Lit, Make the Data Lit
Make the Data, Make the Data Lit, Make the Data Lit, Learn from it
Make the Data Lit, Make the Data Lit,
Make the Data, Make the Data Lit, Learn from it

From Paris to Mexico, and New York to Seoul
We’re called the School of AI and we keep it under control
Listen, If you need some support, I got an SVM
It can split up the data like its for us and them
Models can generate and models can classify
Models can allocate, my model is ride or die
Numbers keep defining all the rules of the game
And all these matrix operations got my feeling insane
Yeah, Turn it up, go, accel-le-erate
And if we go tryna quantum boost then its 10x the rate 
You can hyper-learn it all if theres a will a way
Just bare in mind ,if you over-fit you’ll break your display

I train my bot when Im feeling low, I train my bot till it paints Van Gogh
I train my bot to help visualize, I train my bot till it harmonize

(repeat 2x)
Make the Data Lit, Make the Data Lit
Make the Data, Make the Data Lit, Make the Data Lit, Learn from it
Make the Data Lit, Make the Data Lit,
Make the Data, Make the Data Lit, Learn from it

The games called called evolution. We use technology to evolve. Light the way Wizards, it starts with us.

This is huge! DeepMind didn't yet release the paper or code, so I browsed the CASP reports and different related papers to reverse engineer the architecture as best as I could. What I ended up doing is forking a related research papers code and repurposing it, since its very similar (2 residual networks were used). In this episode, i explain the different components of its architecture, why the protein folding problem is so important, and give some programmatic examples. Enjoy!

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations is the official name of the paper and in it the authors introduce a new type of neural network. This new network doesn't have any layers! Its framed as a differential equation, which allows us to use differential equation solvers on it to approximate the underlying function of time series data. Its very cool and will ultimately allow us to learn from irregular time series datasets more efficiently, which applies to many different industries.

Prove yourself to be absolute,

From the tallest tree to the smallest sprout,
Each rule stands resolute,
Cast away my doubt,

The constants stays devout,
While variables may transmute,
Forever within, Forever Without

I know not what about,
A new puzzle per attribute,
Cast away my doubt,

Approximate to figure out, 
Betwixt experience and compute, 
Forever within, Forever without

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,D3fnGG7cdjY,Geometric Deep Learning,"Geometric Deep Learning is able to draw insights from graph data. That includes social networks, sensor networks, the entire Internet, and even 3D Objects (if we consider point cloud data to be a graph). I'll explain how it works via a demo of me using a graph convolutional network to classify people by their interest in sports teams as well as a 3D object classification demo. At its core, it comes down to being able to learn from non-Euclidean data. Euclid's laws help define certain types of data, so I'll cover some geometry background as well. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,39hNjnhY7cY,Privacy in Data Science,"Learning the tools that preserve user privacy is going to become an increasingly important skillset for all aspiring data scientists to learn in the coming months. Legal frameworks like GDPR are being proposed all around the world as people realize how valuable their data is, so data scientists need to accept that they'll have to handle data differently than in the past. In this video, I'll demo 3 important privacy techniques; differential privacy, secure multi party computation, and federated learning. We'll use these techniques to train a mode built with Python l to predict diabetes while keep user data anonymous. Enjoy!

Using a technology called CRISPR, he made twin baby girls resistant to HIV before they were born. This opened up serious debate across the world on the implications of this technology. I'm going to take this opportunity to give an in-depth analysis of biotechnology, and and answer some really hard questions. Can we really program biology, and if so how? What are the implications of designer babies? Should humans live forever? I really put my heart into this video, I hope you find it useful and inspiring. Enjoy!

This is a device that uses DNA for processing and storage, temporal interference to alter brain states, and infrared spectroscopy to read brain states. Its powered using your body heat, noninvasive, and waterproof. This device is just a thought experiment, but real companies are working on this technology today. What does this kind of technology entail for privacy? Will there be an intelligence disparity? What role does AI play in all of this? What does it even mean to be human? I tackle these hard questions and give a technical overview of this device in this video. Enjoy!

They're now able to generate video of a newscaster using a model trained on real newscaster data and use it to disseminate information 24/7. When I saw this, I knew it was time to start studying China's role in the AI revolution in-depth. In this video, I'll cover China's power structure, generative adversarial networks, its startup scene, Confucianism, the social credit scoring system, algorithmic policing, surveillance, privacy, autonomous weapons, and convolutional neural networks. A lot of different topics to cover, but I hope this video provides a coherent narrative around the use of AI in China and how it plays into the global AI community. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,vcYBiwvauA4,AI that Dresses Itself,"A team of researchers at Google Brain and Georgia Tech developed an AI that learned how to dress itself using various types of clothing. They demonstrated their technology by presenting a video that shows an animated figure gracefully putting on clothing, and the most interesting part is that it learned how to do this by itself. The technique they used was called Trust Region Policy Optimization and its one of the techniques at the forefront of AI research. I'll admit that this was one of the most difficult papers I've ever read, if not the most difficult. The Differentiable Neural Computer paper would be a close 2nd. Using code, animations, theory, and memes, I'll explain how this algorithm works and demonstrate how we can use it to improve our lives in the areas of gaming, elder-care, and factory automation.

Recently, a team at Berkeley published a paper on Curiosity driven learning, and they demonstrated how it helped enable their AI agent to learn how to play the popular game Super Mario Brother very efficiently with the added benefit of curiosity to help Mario explore his options. I'll explain how it works in this video using code, animations, math, and the spoken word. This technology can be used to help make our systems more intelligent, and thus our applications more capable of helping other people. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,MViBvQXQ3mM,Simple Blockchain in 5 Minutes,"A blockchain is a data structure that was first introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin protocol white paper almost a decade ago. Bitcoin's blockchain stores transaction data, but we can store any type of data in a blockchain. Ethereum, for example, enables users to store code snippets called 'smart contracts' in their blockchain. In this video, we'll build a simple blockchain in Python that uses proof-of-work consensus, just like the Bitcoin protocol does. There's a lot of misunderstanding around what the blockchain is and what it can do so I hope this demonstrates how simple it really is. Enjoy!

It's flagship product, the 'news feed', uses an AI algorithm to personalize the content that each user sees. This AI optimizes for a users attention, as thats what drives its ad revenue based business model. Its an incredibly powerful AI that knows users in ways no human could, synthesizing hundreds of thousands of data points from their browsing activity and web history.  In the past few years, we've seen that this AI has had both positive and negative effects on society. I'm going to highlight the negative effects and present 3 possible solutions to fix the problem.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,mCI-f71MAvY,Robotic Manipulation Explained,"Robotics is a vast field of study, encompassing theories across multiple scientific disciplines. In this video, we'll program a robotic arm in a simulated environment to pick up an object. Along the way, we'll learn about both forward and inverse kinematics. We'll optimize our arms trajectory using calculus and observe how its angles change over time, measuring them with trigonometry. We'll code this in Python, this is an example of machine learning applied to robotic manipulation. Enjoy!

Explained,"Everybody Dance Now is a new paper out of UC Berkeley thats able to create photorealistic video of someone dancing in the style of another, more professional dancer. Its like autotune for dance! They trained their model on a source subject (a trained dancer), then were able to transfer that dancing ability onto a target subject. In the video that was generated, the target subject takes on the source subjects dance moves as if it was their own! Incredible work, and it has huge implications for society as a whole. In this video, i'll explain the generative model they used using code and animations, as well as applications of this technology. Enjoy!

That means fast implementations that can outperform preexisting models in other languages, including even (gasp) Python. It’s a useful skill to know and in this live stream I’ll use C and C-based Python tools like Cython + spaCy to develop some really fast natural language processing algorithms for text data. We’ll be able to tokenize, tag, normalize, vectorize, and dependency parse articles of text to derive valuable insights. No installation necessary, we'll do this together using Google Colab in the browser. Join me, there’s a lot to cover here!

All physical products must take a journey from the factory to the consumer and this journey is called the supply chain. Unfortunately, the path to the consumer isn't straightforward, there are sometimes dozens of intermediaries involved in this process. That includes quality assurance, drivers, procurement officers, etc. Blockchain acts as an immutable store of data, and removes the need for one or more third parties. It can help save both businesses and consumers time and money in this case. In this video I'll demo a solidity app that tracks asset, talk about a real world example called SyncFab, and discuss the different ways blockchain can affect the supply chain. Enjoy!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,v9E7Wg0dHiU,Neural Arithmetic Logic Units,"Deepmind released a paper just a few days ago describing a module for neural networks called the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU). Although deep neural networks can learn to represent and manipulate numerical information, they don't generalize well outside of the range of numbers encountered during training.  Meaning train it on the numbers 1-10 and it won't be able to count to 11. To improve this ability, the researchers created an architecture that represents numerical quantities as linear activations which are manipulated using primitive arithmetic operators, controlled by learned gates. Its really fascinating stuff, i'll detail how it works in this video.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,05NqKJ0v7EE,Reinforcement Learning for Stock Prediction,"Can we actually predict the price of Google stock based on a dataset of price history? I’ll answer that question by building a Python demo that uses an underutilized technique in financial market prediction, reinforcement learning. The specific technique we'll use in this video is a subset of RL called Q learning. Using a combination of code, animations, and theory i'll explain how we can let our AI learn a policy for when to buy and sell google stock to maximize profit.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,5Uw1iSwvHH8,Financial Forecasting using Tensorflow.js (LIVE),"Can we use convolutional neural networks for time series analysis? It seems like a strange use case of convolutional networks, since they are generally used for image related tasks. But in recent months, more and more papers have started using convolutional networks for sequence classification. And since stock prices are a sequence, we can use them to make predictions. In this video, i'll use the popular tensorflow.js library to test out a prediction model for Apple stock. I'll also talk about how recurrent networks work as background. This is my first proper live stream in a year. Get hype!

In cases like that, you'll have to code up the paper yourself. That is easier said than done, and in this video i'll show you how you should read and dissect a research paper so you can quickly implement it programmatically. The paper we'll be implementing in this video is called Neural Style transfer, that applies artistic filters to an image using 3 loss functions. Its a great starting point, i'll demo it using code, animations, and math. Enjoy!

We can think of it as an optimization strategy, similar to gradient descent, that can in some cases be faster to converge and give better results. We're going to simulate evolution by creating neural network creatures in javascript and having them evolve over time to try and walk across the screen. I'll discuss the steps that our algorithm will take, then code out the neural network class at the end of the video.

A simulation inside of a simulation. I'll explain how their model was structured both theoretically and programmatically in this video.

The path that a commodity takes through manufacturing, transport, distribution centers, etc. is called the supply chain. The supply chain for most companies is riddled with inefficiencies. Late drivers, bad weather conditions, suboptimal planning, timing issues, the list of things that can go wrong is endless and most of this coordination is done by humans. AI can be used to optimize this entire pipeline, from planning to autonomous transport. In this video i'll demo an app using IBM's Logistic Wizard to optimize a simulated companies supply chain, as well as build a time series forecasting model using Keras to predict the price of a shipment on a certain date.

This allows developers, hobbyists, and researchers to build & train AI models in the browser! It allows for both training and inference to happen entirely client-side, which means we can utilize our users GPUs (all types). This is really exciting, it opens up a whole new world of machine learning possibilities, especially for training on real-time data streams directly from our users. I'll explain the code behind an object detection app using the library in this video, as well as the different parts of the library.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,DCcmFXXAHf4,AI in Medicine |  Medical Imaging Classification (TensorFlow Tutorial),"Can AI be used to detect various diseases from a simple body scan? Yes! Normally, doctors train for years to do this and the error rate is still relatively high. From mammograms to cat scans, AI can diagnose a disease better than any human can if given the right training dataset. This will drastically reduce patient death, save medical practices a lot of money, and aid doctors in the patient care process. Everyone will win and its important to remember that AI won't replace doctors, it will become the most powerful tool they've ever used. And once enough AI startups start impacting the field of healthcare, it will become as common a tool as the stethoscope has been.

Lyrics:

When they update the weights,
They call it back-propagate,
Thats what Every single section of these new papers say,
GPU, go, turn it up, accel-le-rate,
Tryna minimize that loss till its A-OK,
Word2Vec
Input in
Dot product
Activate
Do it once
Do it twice
Input out
Errors Done 
I don’t need a label I’ll just learn do it without one
As long as I’m breathing i’ll predict the outcome

Solve it or I’ll die tryin
Solve It or I’ll die tryin
Solve it or I’ll die tryin
Solve it or I’ll die tryin 

My oh my, who’s this Satoshi?
Shout out to the movement best known as BTC,
I was rocking blockchains back in twenty fourteen
Before Cuban thought that chips mint currency
Tx in
Tx Out
Make a block
Mine it up
Fork the chain,
Commit once
Commit twice
Start a strain 
Lets start a religion that gets cod-di-di-ified
And this is my life, I call it the School of AI, Go!

Solve it or I’ll die tryin
Solve It or I’ll die tryin
Solve it or I’ll die tryin
Solve it or I’ll die tryin 

So Kimmys got a nuke, oh my effing G
From California to Japan, on that F or C
Um will anybody stop it? How bout you or me
Cause Ima fight it to the end like a true O G

The big 4 math disciplines that make up machine learning are linear algebra, probability theory, calculus, and statistics. I'm going to cover how each are used by going through a linear regression problem that predicts the price of an apartment in NYC based on its price per square foot. Then we'll switch over to a logistic regression model to change it up a bit. This will be a hands-on way to see how each of these disciplines are used in the field.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,S47RIVkr978,How to Write a Research Paper,"I'm going to go over the steps you can take to write your first research paper! Research papers have long been something only academics did, but the Internet has offered us several ways to democratize this process. Journals like Arxiv are open for public submissions, machine learning papers are generally open source so anyone can learn from them, and online communities offer advice in the way previously only a professor could. I'll go through these tips in order in as much detail as I can on how to write a research paper.

DensePose is a new architecture by the team at Facebook AI research  that does just that. It uses a convolutional network with some special features like region of interest pooling and cascading to make this happen. It was also trained on a newly created labeled dataset that mapped human poses to 3D models. The team open sourced the dataset but not the code, but using the details in the paper we can recreate their results. I'll explain how it works in this video.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,G5Mx7yYdEhE,Ethereum Future Price Prediction,"Can we predict cryptocurrency prices using machine learning? We're going to build a Keras deep learning model that attemps to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in this video. The type of model i'm using is a bidirectional LSTM recurrent network. Ethereum future prices as well as other cryptocurrency prices are hard to predict, but with the power of machine learning we can find a suitable prediction.

That means the sender, receiver, and transaction amount are not publicly viewable, unlike Bitcoin's blockchain. Monero's transactions stay private using the technology of ring signatures, ringCT, stealth addresses, and I2P routing. I'll explain how all of this works in this video. I do not condone the use of this technology for illegal transactions. This is powerful stuff, ideally, we start using this as a stepping stone towards a world where we get paid for our transactional data (and all the rest of our data).

For the next 10 weeks we're going to go from the basics to the state of the art in this popular subfield of machine learning using video game environments as our testbed. RL is a huge reason DeepMind and OpenAI have been so successful thus far in creating world changing AI bots. Make sure to subscribe so you'll get updated with every new video I release. And don't worry if you don't understand policy iteration or value iteration just yet, I merely wanted to introduce these phrases in this video, next week i'm going to really dive into what these 2 methods look like programmatically.

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,ATaMq62fXno,An intro to Probabilistic Programming with Ubers Pyro,"Probabilistic programming languages are built to harness the predictive power of probability distributions. Instead of making them a feature, they use these distributions as primitives with their own set of operands that allow for the creation of stochastic control flows. Since the real world is full of uncertainty, this type of thinking is useful to help build better AI systems. I'll use Uber's newly released Pyro tool to demonstrate how they work.

Lyrics:

Build it, train it, test it,
Makes it denser, deeper, faster, smarter!

[played in background, continuously:]
Optimize it, make it better,
Adding layers makes it smarter
classifier, generator,
Accurate with lower error,
 
I-I-I got to read papers
To try and make me smarter
i train my models in the cloud now
Cause my laptop takes longer
I parse through data like a boss now
back then my code was wronger
Subscribe if ya wanna learn now
lets spread this AI power

Lets train it right now
Lets train it right now

Lets make bots tonight
and make music like Mozart tonight
And paint artwork on a cross tonight
i’ve waited for this software all my life
Just give it some data and watch it explore
step back, clap and give an Encore
It trained, on forty cores, does Raycer make GPUs anymore?
my game bot started off aimless 
But now its like god in the matrix
My chat bot speaks once I train it
i worked so damn hard to make this
it’ll generate words that it predicts
analyze sentiment, then test it
this def is the shit to Invest in
New data? Wizard train it, then test it, commit !!

i-i-i got to read papers
To try and make me smarter
i train my models in the cloud now
Cause my laptop takes longer
I parse through data like a boss now
back then my code was wronger
Subscribe iff ya wanna learn now
lets spread this AI power

Lets train it right now
Lets train it right now

2 things 
-The embedding visualization at the end would be more spread out if i trained it for more epochs (50 is recommended) but i just used 5.
-The code in the video doesn't fully implement the reparameterization trick (to save space) but check the GitHub repo for details on that.

I met Etan when I was attending Columbia in NYC and now he's a software engineer at Square. I've known him as a hardware hacker, so I thought it'd be fun to collab!

UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A,Siraj Raval,XdM6ER7zTLk,How to Do Linear Regression using Gradient Descent,"The point of this is to demonstrate the concept of gradient descent. Gradient descent is the most popular optimization strategy in deep learning, in particular an implementation of it called backpropagation. We are using gradient descent as our optimization strategy for linear regression. We'll draw the line of best fit to measure the relationship between student test scores and the amount of hours studied. 

Code for this video:
https://github.com/llSourcell/linear_regression_live

Yes, I've done this video before. But I'm doing it again because
1. Gradient Descent is really important. Know how it works.
2. Last time was in Google Hangouts (Ghetto) this is better quality

I traveled to Portland, Oregon for a week to explore/meet people and decided to use the shots I took while hiking to illustrate how math is all around us in the natural world. We can and will discover the rules of intelligence. The fact that it is governed by mathematics only makes it that much more beautiful. From simple rules emerge incredible complexity.

[Chorus]
im not afraid
to understand
every model
from end-to-end
we’ll train this bot together
to perform
we’ll stack those layers
uniform
align our data
pick a platform
strap on if u really wanna learn to code

[Intro]
Yeah, it’s been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just subscribe to me
I'll get you there

[Verse]
You can try and read these errors off my compiler before i make em,
i dont lint my code so makes sense that I’d break em 
my algorithm is dope AF i didnt fake em
when i code it i use Python
i dont give a damn if it breaks,
i’m doing this for you, lets hack it all 
chatty bots and games and machine made music, 
i keep it open source github username is source
to all those who look down on me just call me sirajology
our neural nets’ll see better than biology
self driving cars will drive dreams to reality
learnin syntax and formatting oh so properly
until we get the BSOD on old technology 
learning from our data findin deltas and thetas
we’re pushing every limit writing MATLAB 
(just kidding MATLAB sucks)
i’ll git add i’ll git pull i’ll git push git commit 
until you wizards git from noob to git legit

The political debate fact checker was an idea I had but never got around to building. It takes the transcript from a political debate, extracts the intent of a claim, queries it against google, perhaps scrapes some search result data and then assigns it a truthfulness rating out of 100. If it falls below a certain threshold, that person must be lying! How cool would that be?

=== Lyrics === 

Charlie Chaplin
We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in. machinery that gives abundance, has left us in want. our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness
and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost.

VERSE 1
i was never the type of kid to follow the rules my parents got so mad they said ""study for school!"" i don't give a fuck about tests and shit, don't try to grade me, don't tell me to go study and shit, i have my own dreams own life own mind online  bitch try to take me offline i aint got time tryna to make my own way in this world trying make it, give liberation a whirl so lonely its just me myself  one and only real friends is hard so many phonys its all good I'm moving up i know das wasup life is a marathon ill run till i throw up. Raised in houston but moved up to NYC to join that Ivy University damn right i was dazed and confused i refused to lose i had nothin to choose

But then i found a lab for robots, huh, damn that shit had my name on it.

Charlie Chaplin
Do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed. the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. the hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. and so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

VERSE 2
I was up till the crack of dawn tryin find all the bots in my mind tryin to read shit online then i walked straight up to professor A
""yo can i work in ur lab?' ""sure, and we hope you stay""  those words were sweet to my ears. signed up started playin with motors  n gears no fear i was lead engineer, revolution was here  ""so visionary!"" chuckle  i made a robot startup tryin to make a robot so hot make some toast and a cold pot clean ya dish a whole lot but didn't work we failed a whole lot uh no money no sales  i lost it i failed. passion was lost, taken by jack frost, no longer the boss, robotics was lost...i packed my bags. I left for the West. 

Maybe I could find purpose again i didn't fuckin know

Charle Chaplin
You the people have the power! The power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful. To make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite!

VERSE 3
Shoutout to SF my new home city fuckin love this place man its so very pretty, I'm a dichotomy sirajology i guess  i learned robots were still hot to me. i be machine learnin neural nets Google no Alphabet all that shit uh, world is in flames we gotta make shit better make some robots do some real shit that matters. im tired of all the pain in the world all the hate all the lies all the war all the spies,  tryin make shit blow up for miles, tryin to make us wild, back to the river nile,

INTRO

Shoutout to all them bitcoin warriors out there
Keep fighting the good fight. Don’t be afraid of the feds. Actually a healthy bit of caution is good but. Yeah. anyway

VERSE 1 

Check my temperature, damn i got a fever
it’s spelled BTC yeah i’m a believer
the revolution started back in 2008
Satoshi put pen to paper said it aint too late

the future is now but money exchange is so behind
lets make currency and cryptography align
money and cryptography a beautiful match
send a mil in a minute straight to Kenya and back

no middle men, no limits, no chargebacks
make them digital stacks no wasting time on greenbacks
corruption is enemy, all power centrally
caging us we aint free oh so so many fearfully

network is owned by many not just the few
if you wanna join open a wallet we’ll include you 
that’s right i’m the bitcoin baron
just follow me i’ll take you to bitcoin heaven

HOOK

Freedom of currency
Frees us from tyranny
I said I couldn’t be
without you BTC

Freedom of currency
Frees us from tyranny
I said I couldn’t be
without you BTC

VERSE 2

i rock blockchains playin all them stock games
it’s a public record with no central effort, uh
open source protocol is straight up facts
miners carry SHA 256 on they backs 

they be generatin twenty one million coins
make it rain bitcoin everyday free to join 
banking millions of peeps from china to brazil
everyone wants a piece of that digital shill

They say absolute power corrupts absolutely
well bitcoin disrupts that very same power rudely
i’m looking at you politicians who lie
you be running but aint nowhere to hide

It’s a network that proves its fair and just
We don’t need a God ‘in encryption we trust’!
I have bitcoin dreams of a world that is free
a fantasy of BTC creativity 

HOOK

Freedom of currency
Frees us from tyranny
I said I couldn’t be
without you BTC

Freedom of currency
Frees us from tyranny
I said I couldn’t be
without you BTC

VERSE 3 

if you a bitcoin warrior stand up
we the chosen ones who never give up 
we’ll grow this beast from the west to the east
feds’ll try to stop us we can’t be policed 

it started with one and now its millions
but just wait pretty soon its billions
yea. thats right.worldwide recognize. 
you can’t stop us. decentralized. 

uh. public ledger. 
No secrets. Ever.
heh. Think about it.

===Shoutout===

If you wish to understand and implement a simple, real-time fluid simulator, you can check out my thesis here. It runs on your GPU and comes with source code:

If you are yearning for more, Doyub Kim's Fluid Engine Development is available here:

Ryan Guy's notes on their FLIP Fluids implementation differences from the paper:
- The paper mentions gathering data from nearby particles in some calculations. Our simulator does not perform a nearest-neighbour particle search so we've made some modifications to to avoid this search. 
- Our whitewater generator uses the Signed Distance Field (SDF) of the liquid surface to derive the surface curvature for locating wavecrests. 
- The SDF is also used to test the depth of the particles, such as if they are located inside or outside of the liquid volume. 
- Instead of using the particles to calculate velocity difference (trapped air potential), we are using velocity values that are stored on the grid.

UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg,Two Minute Papers,cLC_GHZCOVQ,OpenAI's Bot Beats DOTA World Champion Dendi | Two Minute Papers #180,"Some updates and clarifications follow:
Update 1: we seem to have conflicting information on the training times - both 24 hours and 2 weeks was mentioned. We'll make sure to address this when the official paper appears. 
Update 2: more from OpenAI - https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/ 
Update 3: more reddit discussion on how to trick the bot into defeat: https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/6t8qvs/openai_bots_were_defeated_atleast_50_times/ (thanks to nikre for the link)
Update 4: an OpenAI employee provides more clarification on the training process - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15001521

Apologies for the inaccuracies - I've watched every video and interview I could get my hands on and found quite a bit of conflicting information. I'll take this into consideration next time when something comes up without an official research paper.

The mentioned previous work has used an SPH-based Lagrangian simulation, performed the regression with regression forests, and the process also has included a fair amount of feature engineering. It is an excellent piece of work by the name ""Data-driven Fluid Simulations using Regression Forests"" and is a highly recommended read:

UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg,Two Minute Papers,HvHZXPd0Bjs,Interactive Hair-Solid Simulations | Two Minute Papers #90,"We have talked about fluid and cloth simulations earlier, but we never really set foot in the domain of hair simulations in the series. 

To obtain some footage of virtual hair movement, simulating the dynamics of hundreds of thousands of hair strands is clearly too time consuming and would be a flippant attempt to do so. In this episode, we discuss a technique to faithfully simulate 150 thousand hair strands by using only 400 guide hairs.

UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg,Two Minute Papers,flOevlA9RyQ,Visually Indicated Sounds | Two Minute Papers #79,"The Scholarly Store is available here: https://shop.spreadshirt.net/TwoMinutePapers

Using the power of deep learning, it is now possible to create a technique that looks at a silent video and synthesize appropriate sound effects for it. The usage is at the moment, limited to hitting these objects with a drumstick.

Note: The authors seem to lean on a database of sounds, i.e., the synthesis does not happen from scratch, but they are not merely fetching the database entry for a given sound, but performing example-based synthesis (Section 5.2 in the paper below). In the video and the paper, they both use the words ""synthesized sound"" and ""predicted sound"", and it may be a bit unclear what degree of synthesis qualifies as a ""synthesized sound"". I think this is definitely worthy of further scrutiny.

Today, we're going to talk about both many cool useful applications of convolutions and there will be a bit of intuition on how the computation is done. Among other cool applications, it turns out we can add very convincing reverberation effects to our guitars by computing convolutions.

Quick note from Lex: The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes in. Most folks still just listen to audio-only version, but here on YouTube, we did our best to still make it interesting to watch & listen by adding image overlays. I mess things up sometimes, like in this case, and it hits me hard when I do. But I'm always working hard to improve. I hope you understand. Thank you for your patience and support along the way. I love you all.

UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman,Iy_oYCNhiUI,The biggest chess game ever,"My first chess video. It's two Stockfish 14 chess AI engines playing each other on a chess board that is infinitely expanding outwards, initializing the squares at the edges with middlegames from 30,000 grandmaster games including from Carlsen, Fischer, Kasparov, Spassky, Tal, Karpov, and so on.

I love chess, always have, but chose to stop playing it myself early on when I became passionate about building AI systems, and instead became a fan of watching the game and the humans who play it.

EDIT NOTE: I edited this episode quickly and made a couple of mistakes in how rough the cut looks. One weird cut is after the 2 hour mark, where it sounds like Bret is about to make a point, but I actually interrupt him for clarification and then go of on a tangent and never return. I edited out the interruption which made the cut look weird. I failed here both as an interviewer and editor. I'm trying to get better at both, and hire help for the latter, since I still do it all alone. Please be patient with me.

UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman,KllCrlfLuzs,Richard Karp: Algorithms and Computational Complexity | Lex Fridman Podcast #111,"Richard Karp is a professor at Berkeley and one of the key figures in the history of theoretical computer science. In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called ""Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems"", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.

UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman,naed4C4hfAg,David Patterson: Computer Architecture and Data Storage | Lex Fridman Podcast #104,"David Patterson is a Turing award winner and professor of computer science at Berkeley. He is known for pioneering contributions to RISC processor architecture used by 99% of new chips today and for co-creating RAID storage. The impact that these two lines of research and development have had on our world is immeasurable. He is also one of the great educators of computer science in the world. His book with John Hennessy ""Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"" is how I first learned about and was humbled by the inner workings of machines at the lowest level.

I came across Dmitry's work when in February his group used the viral genome of the COVID-19 to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins and their interactions with human proteins, in effect creating a structural genomics map of the coronavirus and making this data open and available to researchers everywhere. We talked about the biology of COVID-19, SARS, and viruses in general, and how computational methods can help us understand their structure and function in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.

Stephen Wolfram is a computer scientist, mathematician, and theoretical physicist who is the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language, and the new Wolfram Physics project. He is the author of several books including A New Kind of Science, which on a personal note was one of the most influential books in my journey in computer science and artificial intelligence.

UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman,UfMyp1wFgxE,The Way Out | Lex Fridman (Original),"I wrote this song yesterday, thinking about the time we're in, about my grandfather in WWII, about the strength of community and the human spirit in tough times. Here are the lyrics:

the way out

my granddad was a soldier
on the fronts in 41
the bullets took his brothers
but his stubborn luck held on

the sky was filled with fire
millions lost in flames
hate and love were all there
and the world's never the same

 some days will sink in sadness
 and the weight of them too tough
 don't lose yourself to madness
 the way out is love

when the new york towers crumbled
we were all new yorkers too
for a moment all just human
not the same old red or blue

and the wicked'll go on scheming
for the power in the pain
but the heart that longs for freedom
is a fire they'll never tame

 some days will sink in sadness
 and the weight of them too tough
 don't lose yourself to madness
 the way out is love

the virus took our comfort
that was never  ours to own
when the enemy is inside us
we're together but alone

this life is so damn fragile
a leaf caught by the wind
but every breath that's tragic
ignites a hope within

 some days will sink in sadness
 and the weight of them too tough
 don't lose yourself to madness
 the way out is love",2020-04-06T10:28:15Z,112246,5260,447

In this video I describe what, to me, might be 7 levels of attack on our society and how we can fight back. For each level, I describe our pain, our challenge, and our hope for a positive future on the other side.

* Note about the new addition on the table: Hedgy is a stuffed hedgehog toy that I got in a thrift store many years ago. He jumped out at me because he seemed to be deep in thought and bothered by something profound, in stark contrast to other stuffed animals that usually have an aloof, empty smile on their face. I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff. So what you get is Hedgy.

She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9. It is hosted, once again, by the fun and brilliant Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Alex Garland, writer and director of many imaginative and philosophical films from the dreamlike exploration of human self-destruction in the movie Annihilation to the deep questions of consciousness and intelligence raised in the movie Ex Machina, which to me is one of the greatest movies on artificial intelligence ever made. I'm releasing this podcast to coincide with the release of his new series called Devs that will premiere this Thursday, March 5, on Hulu as part of ""FX on Hulu"". It explores many of the themes this very podcast is about: from quantum mechanics to artificial life to simulation to the modern nature of power in the tech world.

I've been getting a lot of great questions on Patreon, so I'm trying a new thing (this video) where I answer one or a few questions on a particular topic in a 5-20 minute AMA. The aim is to do one a week. Let me know what you think. I apologize for the slow pace of talking. I'm learning how to communicate better without getting lost in my thoughts. My brain seems to work much faster than I speak, so I go down mental tangents which counter-intuitively slows the speaking. The brain is fascinating ;-)

This video is from an AMA I did on Patreon a while ago. I'll post a few of those and then start doing new ones. Let me know if once a week is too frequent, not frequent enough or just right.",2020-02-19T17:07:15Z,138582,8190,313

Daniel Kahneman is winner of the Nobel Prize in economics for his integration of economic science with the psychology of human behavior, judgment and decision-making. He is the author of the popular book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" that summarizes in an accessible way his research of several decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky, on cognitive biases, prospect theory, and happiness. The central thesis of this work is a dichotomy between two modes of thought: ""System 1"" is fast, instinctive and emotional; ""System 2"" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates cognitive biases associated with each type of thinking.

Sebastian Thrun is one of the greatest roboticists, computer scientists, and educators of our time. He led development of the autonomous vehicles at Stanford that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge and placed second in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. He then led the Google self-driving car program which launched the self-driving revolution. He taught the popular Stanford course on Artificial Intelligence in 2011 which was one of the first MOOCs. That experience led him to co-found Udacity, an online education platform. He is also the CEO of Kitty Hawk, a company working on building flying cars or more technically eVTOLS which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech and Santa Fe Institute specializing in quantum mechanics, arrow of time, cosmology, and gravitation. He is the author of several popular books and is a host of a great podcast called Mindscape.

So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

Dava Newman is the Apollo Program professor of AeroAstro at MIT and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA and has been a principal investigator on four spaceflight missions. Her research interests are in aerospace biomedical engineering, investigating human performance in varying gravity environments. She has developed a space activity suit, namely the BioSuit, which would provide pressure through compression directly on the skin via the suit's textile weave, patterning, and materials rather than with pressurized gas.

Michael Kearns is a professor at University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new book Ethical Algorithm that is the focus of much of our conversation, including algorithmic fairness, bias, privacy, and ethics in general. But, that is just one of many fields that Michael is a world-class researcher in, some of which we touch on quickly including learning theory or theoretical foundations of machine learning, game theory, algorithmic trading, quantitative finance, computational social science, and more.

Note: I select clips with insights from these much longer conversation with the hope of helping make these ideas more accessible and discoverable. Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on this channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion.

Bjarne Stroustrup is the creator of C++, a programming language that after 34 years is still one of the most popular and powerful languages in the world. Its focus on fast, stable, robust code underlies many of the biggest systems in the world that we have come to rely on as a society. If you're watching this on YouTube, many of the critical back-end component of YouTube are written in C++. Same goes for Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, most Microsoft applications, Adobe applications, most database systems, and most physical systems that operate in the real-world like cars, robots, rockets that launch us into space and one day will land us on Mars.

Ultimately, this podcast is a small side hobby for me with the goal of sharing and discussing ideas. For now, I post a few clips every Tue & Fri. I did a poll and 92% of people either liked or loved the posting of daily clips, 2% were indifferent, and 6% hated it, some suggesting that I post them on a separate YouTube channel. I hear the 6% and partially agree, so am torn about the whole thing. I tried creating a separate clips channel but the YouTube algorithm makes it very difficult for that channel to grow unless the main channel is already very popular. So for a little while, I'll keep posting clips on the main channel. I ask for your patience and to see these clips as supporting the dissemination of knowledge contained in nuanced discussion. If you enjoy it, consider subscribing, sharing, and commenting.

Yann LeCun is one of the fathers of deep learning, the recent revolution in AI that has captivated the world with the possibility of what machines can learn from data. He is a professor at New York University, a Vice President & Chief AI Scientist at Facebook, co-recipient of the Turing Award for his work on deep learning. He is probably best known as the founder of convolutional neural networks, in particular their early application to optical character recognition.

Sean Carroll is a theoretical physicist at Caltech, specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology. He is the author of several popular books: one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here, one on the Higgs boson called The Particle at the End of the Universe, and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture: On the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself. He has an upcoming book on Quantum Mechanics that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden. He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website preposterousuniverse.com. I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link that lists accessible, interesting posts on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy, the Big Bang, general relativity, string theory, quantum mechanics, and meta questions about the philosophy of science, God, Ethics, Politics, Academia, and much much more. Finally, and perhaps most famously, he is the host of a podcast called Mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.

UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman,f8iTPmrh3Yk,Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd Cover),"Acoustic guitar cover of Simple Man by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Music is a solitary refuge for me so it took a lot for me to post Comfortably Numb last year (https://youtu.be/Khf-N2f8T78) and even more to sing on this one. Let me know if you have song requests for next year, and maybe before. Maybe one day I'll play an original song as well.

This song was recorded with Ableton Live. It has 3 guitar tracks. The video shows me playing one of the tracks. Next time, instead of layering, I'll just do it with a single track and a loop pedal like I would if I was playing it live. I'm new to recording music. The goal is to always be improving and enjoying the process, in all things, which I do.
