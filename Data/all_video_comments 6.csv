The woke-cult is brainwashed to think that the Bill of Rights are bad and that ordinary voters are too stupid to hear all sides of arguments.  Dorsey implicitly at least encouraged that.  And he pretended to be ignorant of the Twitter&#39;s anti-freedom policies when confronted on Rogan.

CwyOUS8TSl0,UgwU4Su1ay2-5zbg-yV4AaABAg,"You asked him about mutation... I don&#39;t think people should be concerned about mutation to becoming more dangerous.  That has literally never happened, and it would not be an advantageous mutation for the virus.  Viruses do not want to be ebola.  Viruses want to be herpes.  Their &quot;goal&quot;, in as far as an organism that is not even alive, cannot reproduce itself, cannot move, has no metabolism, etc, is to persist and spread (get copied).  Viruses which kill their host do not continue to get copied.  They are failures.  In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it includes a &#39;proofreader&#39; component, which is pretty unusual for a virus (but common to coronaviruses).  The purpose of that proofreader is to repair mutations.  That doesn&#39;t make them impossible, but MUCH less likely.  The genetic drift seen since its initial discovery in Wuhan is VERY small, much smaller than we would expect to see.  And 100% of those mutations have been non-functional.  They&#39;re used as &#39;markers&#39; for virologists to track the virus, but there are very few of them.  (I believe they can tell if the one you got came from NY or the WA outbreaks, though, some of the markers differ there.)  Functional mutations that actually change how a circulating virus affects people are not uncommon.  We haven&#39;t seen them in SARS-CoV-2 yet, though.  And every one we have seen in any other virus always, every single time, makes it LESS pathogenic.  Viruses need us for everything.  They really don&#39;t want to kill us.  Heck, the viruses that give us the most trouble come from other species, they&#39;re not even built to work in us.  That&#39;s why zoonotic diseases make the &#39;mistake&#39; of killing people.",@DustinRodriguez1_0,1.0,2020-04-29T21:19:42Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

This simplified structure makes them different than bacteria, for example, but no less alive. They are a unique life form. They are very much like seeds (or spores): They only grow when they find the right soil in which to do so. And like seeds, even though in a suspended state, they constantly monitor the exterior world around them.  They change, they communicate and they replicate.

V37eWVm-9BA,Ugz5I9pbbgzG9rZbmGt4AaABAg,"Great interview but i feel that Wolfram&#39;s attempts to put him self on the same level as Feynman was pretty cringe worthy. No doubt Stephen Wolfram is a really smart guy, but he comes across as boarder-line delusional in the way he portrays his own mental abilities. The idea that he has been sitting on a stack of Feynman&#39;s notes which he has &#39;yet to have time to look at&#39; is total nonsense. There is almost a zero percent chance that he hasn&#39;t looked at them. Rather, he almost certainly would have looked at them (and perhaps still does), but just can&#39;t understand what Feynman did. At heart (and at his own admission), Wolfram is a businessman who finds brilliant minds and puts them to use in a very smart way. I think WolframAlpha and his other technical contributions are fantastic and he has done the world a great many services, but I also think its pretty clear he is no genius like Feynman was.

Perhaps intelligence involves the ability to recognize and utilize &quot;pockets of reducibility&quot;, and that the key to finding a theory of everything requires that we&#39;re able to utilize the right pockets.

As the latter definition (of what it is) only exists in that one particular state or in that single relativistic instance (which depends on the speed / position of the observers). So the propagation of the hyper-graph edges through abstract hyper-time are the more important constructions compared to the nodes (vertices) of the graph.

Out of more than 100 &quot;simple rules&quot; only two rules result in &quot;complex behavior&quot;.  How are we supposed to believe that this is how the universe works?? The universe, almost literally, is a computational process governed by a simple rule that yields complex phenomenon. Why should we believe that the underlying rule is simple?

VguG_y05Xe8,UgxpuW3ifeRF58XNcdB4AaABAg,i think the better way to explain it is the basic construct that is used in lambda calculus can be used as key tool where the basic propositional calculus or predicate calculus   where logic can be used as an computation where and and nand and xnor gate can be used to compute any thing from strings or numbers or anything but the basic construct which is not being any of the wolfram video please tell it in another video if iam wrong be kind and correct me where the schools teach computers as pure number system but functional programming and cellular automata tells that gates and every thing used in computation is a function but dont even try to open the mathematical portal from here because the inversion is not allowed as function in lambda calculus but in group theory it does switching a number and getting a answer is thought in many schools but composition of function which does the magic makes Turing complete from gta to arithmetic and even word-processing is done by considering everything and a function and construct are developed and a higher grammar is used in computation  even 1 2 3 and even everything is an function from true and false are also function which are developed but how the cellular automata is related the rules are related to lambda calculus and physics the rules emanate from simple rules but not hard encoded or is inside the code and after the graphs develop emanate and develop the computational algorithm and theory is enumerated no video in you tube tells this basic information correctly i guess if i am wrong please correct me i never shy away to learn even i fail,@ranam,0.0,2022-11-06T08:27:16Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

How many steps or generations would that take? Could be infinite in a manner of speaking seeing that Infinity itself equates to a complete balance of opposites (positive/negative forces). <br><br>I don&#39;t know why we find this so fascinating if we posit the idea that the Universe began from The Big Bang which is essentially the same as saying the entire Universe sprang forth from one simple bit of information. This information repeats itself in ever more complex ways no different than a human being begins as one simple bit of information; a single-cell organism called a Zygote that repeats itself in ever more complicated ways over the course of 9 months until it results in a complex multi-cell organism called a baby. Even though all the organs and parts of the baby may appear different from the other, every bit of the baby reflects the same genetic information down to the hair follicles. <br><br>We could make the same argument for mathematics. All numbers are really just an extenuation of ONE number. There really is no such number as 72 because 72 is really just the number One repeated 72 times... Again, complex information that emerges from simplicity.

VguG_y05Xe8,UgwpbWl8Jra9N4MRKqJ4AaABAg,"Perhaps I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t this all to do with symmetry? Wolfram says: it <b>*looks*</b> random. That just means the initial rule remains the rule, instead of creating a recognizable large scale pattern you can <b>*recognize*</b> as symmetrical enough to <b>*look*</b> non random. And some rules tend towards symmetry and others do not. <br><br>In other words, trying to find the larger pattern is like trying to predict the pattern before the rule does. You have already predicted the pattern, by letting the rule run. There is no alternative to letting the rule run, or the pattern would not be made from this rule. In other words, your rule from the very beginning would hide some other rule. But it cannot. Because at the beginning, there is only the rule, by definition, and the pattern only arises from the propagation of the rule through your defined method of propagation: <b>*line by line*</b> .<br><br>It is therefore the <b>*lines*</b> that you are not taking into account, the geometry of the rule is modified by each new line. It&#39;s like saying the rule is different at each new line. So of course you can&#39;t find the general pattern, because you have to let the rule run one line to find the new rule, that you can then run another line, to find the next rule, then run the rule another line to find the next, etc.<br><br>And you&#39;re already doing that! There is no shortcut to life. To geometry. Or it would not be geometry. <br><br>More deeply, I think confusion can arise from the idea we are using physics to predict behaviours of limited systems. But only of limited systems. We are certainly not capable of predicting exactly how, say, human society on Earth will evolve. We limit ourselves to very, very basic predictions, like where an electron might end up in an orbit. But can we predict where they all will end up at time T in order to predict electrical impulses&#39; trajectories in every single brain on Earth, to predict social events, like when people will get tired of an unfair political system? No. At least, not yet.<br><br>Yet this is physics. This should be possible. And indeed it is, when we accept the fact that the rules change based on how the previous set of rules ran for a specific time. For instance I couldn&#39;t have predicted how the popularity of social media would evolve in 2006 when Facebook went worldwide, but judging on how people are reacting to it now, Twitter feuds, and opinion of Mark Zuckerberg, etc, (a new line has run), I can tell that there will be issues in the near future. Because I didn&#39;t try to predict the entire universe from its original state. <br><br>This is a clue, that reality organises itself  one line at a time, one event, one action, one interaction, one exchange of force, of energy, at a time. It is likely <b>*local*</b> change, that IS the rule. And the complexity we observe is simply complex <b>*to us*</b> , because it is not made like we are, so we understand ourselves, but not the world. Or at least not as well as we have the <b>*opportunity*</b> to discover ourselves.<br><br>It is all simple geometry, movement begetting movement, one step, one line, at a time. That is likely why it is unpredictable. Because you aren&#39;t taking into account that the rule evolves and reexpresses itself within its current geometry. Its current line. Our current moment.

Although I have seen ‘rules’ for bird flocks, where they avoid obstacles, fly together, and slightly change their own patterns to mimics those near them, and even a few simple rules can mimic the complex behaviors of life.",@FurryEskimo,1.0,2020-05-04T15:22:08Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

ez773teNFYA,UgyS4BV0gUKXiQ999Mt4AaABAg,"Stephen and Lex, a Computer Universe is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key.   <br>And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1.

Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement.

Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>“The greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↓α is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity.<br><br>“The lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                  -Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br>  <br>Where:<br><br>QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑α is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>“The equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑↓0α is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br>For more detailed information on these 3-in-1 Trinity Laws and Equations for Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation, and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - The Real True Nature of Quantum Gravitation, look it up at the two scientific journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE or google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA.<br><br>Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

Unlike so many other products of its type, this CD does not have bad synthesizer music, does not feature a phony or affected style of narration, and does not make any bogus claims to be  subliminal  or to  re-train the brain  or any of that balderdash. What you get is 1. a guided meditation for getting into a pleasantly relaxed state of body awareness while taking a stroll (superb for those easing back into a fitness routine slowly after an illness or injury) 2. A nice long breath-awareness relaxation session that if followed diligently can put you into very deep states of full-body relaxation and mental calmness, and 3. a buddhist-inspired meditation session designed to help you develop and maintain feelings of loving kindness toward not just yourself and your friends, but toward people you don&#39;t even like. The CD makes no claims to be designed for advanced meditators or for buddhists or hindus/yoga practitioners looking for very deep and esoteric stuff. It is geared more toward the average person who just wants to develop the habit of relaxation and stress relief through natural, healthy means. him, if you happen to be reading this, keep up the good work fella, and I love your accent. I would also like to note that I have never fallen asleep while listening to this product. I would like to kindly suggest to the reviewer who said this CD makes him fall asleep, that he might want to get checked to see if he has a sleep disorder, or if he is simply not setting aside ample time for restful sleep at night.

See for example the story of Hugh Everett III, the originator of the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation of quantum physics (by means of the PhD dissertation he wrote in the 50s, while studying at Princeton)—a theory that was systematically prevented from taking root in academia by the existing gatekeepers of what constituted acceptable discourse at the time, who had created the existing Copenhagen Interpretation (established by Bohr, Heisenberg, et al.) and used their credentials to prevent the advancement of any dissenting theories. In summary, he became so demotivated by the active academic censorship at the time that he left Princeton after completing his PhD, to establish a career working for the defense industry. And in case anybody wonders: in retrospect, with the additional advances in understanding that accrued in subsequent decades, it can now be objectively said that those gatekeepers were an overall impediment to the advancement of knowledge, and without justification (it&#39;s not as if the many worlds theory can be said to aid in the development of fantastically destructive weapons—not like some of the contributions from members of the opposing team).",@user-kc2gi7eq1y,0.0,2023-09-08T21:58:23Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

In sum, this Pythagorean localization represents the pass of the baton inherent to tracing out and reconciling the pathways, the vectors of expansion versus the vectors of the orbit within the wavefunction.

fgGZMRJ15oY,UgzoOUFHZ0I6tH5p3jJ4AaABAg,"Right out of the gate, the mere idea that the most persons must have abridged versions of any kind of information is completely and utterly routed for failure. The technology and communication advances in the last two decades should have led to a worldwide increase in intelligence and honesty in and from our governments and world leaders. It had the polar opposite effect. Adults now must be entertained as if they were children, and view any learned environment as boring or non engaging. Books and reading are becoming increasingly obsolete, as information is transferred into video clips. Subsequently, the average attention span had decreased so dramatically that the average American student is a decade behind their counterparts in most of Europe and Asia. It is beyond disheartening to see such opportunities for enlightenment being completely wasted all in the name of self gratification. We now rely on these devices to spell for us, and grammar and sentence structure is not even part of the curriculum in grade schools. I have three honor-students that are my children, all in high school just outside the nation’s capital, and none of them were taught what an adverb is, or a pronoun, or how to properly diagram a sentence. We are intentionally being dumbed down, and physically being poisoned to create a weaker and stupid general population. Growing up in a class of 300 there were maybe a dozen kids who were overweight. Now it seems to be the norm, the average. Students are fat, lazy and remarkably dumber than my generation, which is brutally difficult for me to see. It was literally accomplished in a generation using these devices as a weapon. Having a weakened, moronic base allows a vitriolic government to manipulate and control with greater ease. Just look at who we have come to accept as our leaders; our government runs rampant with morons and ideologies based around hate. Half of Americans believe that education and healthcare are not important issues in relation to our kids. It’s terrifying. There is more a dangerous combination than hate and stupidity, and those two things seem to be most prevalent in our society. We are fast approaching a point of no return, if we haven’t already. And the division created by hate and fostered by stupidity only grows, as these weaponized devices continue to infiltrate and indoctrinate the youngest and most impressionable. For example, before social media became so prevalent, children’s answers to what they wanted to be when they grew up would usually be a doctor, a lawyer, a police officer, educator, etc. Noble and useful careers which would contribute to a better society for the most part. Now those answers are YouTuber, Instagram model, and TikToker…I shudder to think how delusional we have all become. None of this is sustainable, and point of fact, the damage is cataclysmic and has progressed far faster and reached far beyond what I previously would have thought possible. I have grown past worry for our future into fear of the immediate and inevitable end…Not just of the American way of life, but of all life as we know it.

_2ISnlT7j9A,Ugyr8UsKlt5dhmKejGd4AaABAg,"I like Eric, I like Elon. In these comments I think that Eric does not give Elon enough credit - and yet in another sense he is correct. Although Elon is quite proficient in ordinary physics and excellent in engineering, he is optimizing traditional physics - mostly Newtonian physics - rather than making groundbreaking discoveries about the universe; and his genius is really as a businessman bringing new technologies to the masses and as a salesman selling big ideas to the public.<br><br>So from Eric&#39;s perspective as a top level physicist, Elon appears competent but nothing special - and he&#39;s probably right about that as far as physics go. Eric knows lots of extremely smart people who probably understand physics better than Elon, so he naturally thinks that there are lots of other people who could do the same thing if they just put their mind to it - and at one level he is correct. What he is missing (and in fairness what most people are missing) is that it requires a very rare ability to combine multiple fields like physics, engineering, chemistry, economics, business, and salesmanship into a successful enterprise that can actually push humanity forward to become a spacefaring species.<br><br>Most cultures around the world actively seek to suppress such business geniuses. In fact, the United States is a rare exception not in that such suppression doesn&#39;t happen but in that there are enough people pushing back to provide entrepreneurs some breathing room. The issue is that most humans are hardwired to have moral beliefs about fairness that made perfect sense in the zero sum game of paleolithic hunter-gatherers, but which are actively injurious to humanity in the age of modern economies and modern technology. The United States is one of the rare places where a sufficient proportion of the population is wired to intuitively grasp modern economic conditions that allow these advances to occur, thus improving living conditions for all of humanity.<br><br>And that is what Eric is not acknowledging here - that the qualities that make Elon so rare are not about his knowledge of physics, but his abilities for optimization and organization and salesmanship that allow these new technologies to be actualized.",@alanlight7740,0.0,2022-03-04T15:42:24Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Likewise, Elon has not invented anything. He has succeeded so far in Manufacturing electric automobiles, rockets for the government and electric backup systems for local utilities. He has correctly concluded that the money is in government Supply. He is joining the industrial government complex. He may be joining the military industrial complex because his rocket to the space station Took 48 hours to arrive at the space station. Where do you think that rocket was for those 48 hours? It only took the Russians 2 hours to deliver our astronauts to the space station. So, the missing 46 hours must have been involved in some kind of classified operations which we can reasonably conclude were on the behalf of the military, as we have no information about the Lost Time.

vdW9XDBuxjU,UgyZTNamHKQNGyp9Rv54AaABAg,"Eric and Lex, A Theory of Everything is possible only if we have a truly empirical testable theory of Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>“The greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↓α is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity.<br><br>“The lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                  -Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br>  <br>Where:<br><br>QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑α is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>“The equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑↓0α is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br>For more detailed information on these 3-in-1 Trinity Laws and Equations for Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation, and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - The Real True Nature of Quantum Gravitation, look it up at the two scientific journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE or google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA.<br><br>Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

The observer in the Andromeda galaxy sees our galaxy and we are on our edge and that observer is flat and you in the Milkyway look at the observer in the Andromeda and it is on it&#39;s edge and your flat. Both see XYZ even when they look directly at one another. That&#39;s VEM =0Msquared. Just sayin that&#39;s the reason for this anomaly.

vdW9XDBuxjU,Ugxjvp34SA0kkTDAQuV4AaABAg,"Eric and Lex, to realize the Theory of Everything in Physics, the last and final puzzle  conundrum of Quantum Gravity has to be solved  first. The scientific community and you  knew that String Theory is not yet a scientific theory.  And General Relativity&#39;s Curvature of Spacetime Gravity is hugely incomplete,  highly flawed and therefore wrong- the reason why it did not win a Nobel Prize for Einstein. Instead, he won a Nobel Prize for Physics for his work in Quantum Mechanics&#39; Photoelectric Effect.<br><br>Quantum Gravity is real. We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical laws and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement in Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.",@roelrovira5148,0.0,2024-02-14T18:06:31Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

vdW9XDBuxjU,UgwXscxis3GKw1M13gJ4AaABAg,"Conservation of Spatial Curvature (both Matter and Energy described as &quot;Quanta&quot; of Spatial Curvature)<br><br>Is there an alternative interpretation of &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;?  What if Quarks are actually made up of twisted tubes which become physically entangled with two other twisted tubes to produce a proton?  Instead of the Strong Force being mediated by the exchange of gluons, it would be mediated by the physical entanglement of these twisted tubes.  When only two twisted tubules are entangled, a meson is produced which is unstable and rapidly unwinds (decays) into something else.   A proton would be analogous to three twisted rubber bands becoming entangled and the &quot;Quarks&quot; would be the places where the tubes are tangled together.  The behavior would be the same as rubber balls (representing the Quarks) connected with twisted rubber bands being separated from each other or placed closer together producing the exact same phenomenon as &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot; in protons and neutrons.  The force would become greater as the balls are separated, but the force would become less if the balls were placed closer together.<br>------------------------<br>String Theory was not a waste of time, because Geometry is the key to Math and Physics.  However, can we describe Standard Model interactions using only one extra spatial dimension?<br><br>What if we describe subatomic particles as spatial curvature, instead of trying to describe General Relativity as being mediated by particles?<br><br>Quantum Entangled Twisted Tubules:  <br>“We are all agreed that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct.”    Neils Bohr<br>(lecture on a theory of elementary particles given by Wolfgang Pauli in New York, c. 1957–8, in Scientific American vol. 199, no. 3, 1958)<br><br>The following is meant to be a generalized framework for an extension of Kaluza-Klein Theory.  Does it agree with the “Twistor Theory” of Roger Penrose?   During the early history of mankind, the twisting of fibers was used to produce thread, and this thread was used to produce fabrics.   The twist of the thread is locked up within these fabrics.  Is matter made up of twisted 3D-4D structures which store spatial curvature that we describe as “particles&quot;?   Are the twist cycles the &quot;quanta&quot; of Quantum Mechanics?<br><br>When we draw a sine wave on a blackboard, we are representing spatial curvature. Does a photon transfer spatial curvature from one location to another? Wrap a piece of wire around a pencil and it can produce a 3D coil of wire, much like a spring. When viewed from the side it can look like a two-dimensional sine wave. You could coil the wire with either a right-hand twist, or with a left-hand twist. Could Planck&#39;s Constant be proportional to the twist cycles. A photon with a higher frequency has more energy.  ( E=hf, More spatial curvature as the frequency increases = more Energy ). What if gluons are actually made up of these twisted tubes which become entangled with other tubes to produce quarks. (In the same way twisted electrical extension cords can become entangled.) Therefore, the gluons are a part of the quarks. Quarks cannot exist without gluons, and vice-versa. Mesons are made up of two entangled tubes (Quarks/Gluons), while protons and neutrons would be made up of three entangled tubes. (Quarks/Gluons) The &quot;Color Force&quot; would be related to the XYZ coordinates (orientation) of entanglement. &quot;Asymptotic Freedom&quot;, and &quot;flux tubes&quot; are logically based on this concept. The Dirac “belt trick” also reveals the concept of twist in the ½ spin of subatomic particles.   If each twist cycle is proportional to h, we have identified the source of Quantum Mechanics as a consequence twist cycle geometry.  <br><br>Modern physicists say the Strong Force is mediated by a constant exchange of Mesons. The diagrams produced by some modern physicists actually represent the Strong Force like a spring connecting the two quarks. Asymptotic Freedom acts like real springs. Their drawing is actually more correct than their theory and matches perfectly to what I am saying in this model. You cannot separate the Gluons from the Quarks because they are a part of the same thing. The Quarks are the places where the Gluons are entangled with each other. <br><br>Neutrinos would be made up of a twisted torus (like a twisted donut) within this model. The twist in the torus can either be Right-Hand or Left-Hand.   Some twisted donuts can be larger than others, which can produce three different types of neutrinos.   If a twisted tube winds up on one end and unwinds on the other end as it moves through space, this would help explain the “spin” of normal particles, and perhaps also the “Higgs Field”.   However, if the end of the twisted tube joins to the other end of the twisted tube forming a twisted torus (neutrino), would this help explain “Parity Symmetry” violation in Beta Decay?  Could the conversion of twist cycles to writhe cycles through the process of supercoiling help explain “neutrino oscillations”? Spatial curvature (mass) would be conserved, but the structure could change. <br><br>Gravity is a result of a very small curvature imbalance within atoms. (This is why the force of gravity is so small.) Instead of attempting to explain matter as &quot;particles&quot;, this concept attempts to explain matter more in the manner of our current understanding of the space-time curvature of gravity. If an electron has qualities of both a particle and a wave, it cannot be either one. It must be something else. Therefore, a &quot;particle&quot; is actually a structure which stores spatial curvature. Can an electron-positron pair (which are made up of opposite directions of twist) annihilate each other by unwinding into each other producing Gamma Ray photons?  <br><br>Does an electron travel through space like a threaded nut traveling down a threaded rod, with each twist cycle proportional to Planck’s Constant?  Does it wind up on one end, while unwinding on the other end?   Is this related to the Higgs field?  Does this help explain the strange ½ spin of many subatomic particles?  Does the 720 degree rotation of a 1/2 spin particle require at least one extra dimension? <br><br> Alpha decay occurs when the two protons and two neutrons (which are bound together by entangled tubes), become un-entangled from the rest of the nucleons<br><br>. Beta decay occurs when the tube of a down quark/gluon in a neutron becomes overtwisted and breaks producing a twisted torus (neutrino) and an up quark, and the ejected electron. The phenomenon of Supercoiling involving twist and writhe cycles may reveal how overtwisted quarks can produce these new particles. The conversion of twists into writhes, and vice-versa, is an interesting process.<br><br> Gamma photons are produced when a tube unwinds producing electromagnetic waves.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>Within this model a black hole could represent a quantum of gravity, because it is one cycle of spatial gravitational curvature.   Therefore, instead of a graviton being a subatomic particle it could be considered to be a black hole.   The overall gravitational attraction would be caused by a very tiny curvature imbalance within atoms.  We know there is an unequal distribution of electrical charge within each atom because the positive charge is concentrated within the nucleus, even though the overall electrical charge of the atom is balanced by equal positive and negative charge.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>In this model Alpha equals the compactification ratio within the twistor cone, which is approximately  1/137.<br><br>1= Hypertubule diameter at 4D interface<br><br>137= Cone’s larger end diameter at 3D interface where the photons are absorbed or emitted.<br><br>The 4D twisted Hypertubule gets longer or shorter as twisting or untwisting occurs.   (720 degrees per twist cycle.)  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>How many neutrinos are left over from the Big Bang?  They have a small mass, but they could be very large in number.

Is Dirac’s belt trick related to this model?    Is the “Quantum” unit based on twist cycles? <br><br>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br><br>I started out imagining a subatomic Einstein-Rosen Bridge whose internal surface is twisted with either a Right-Hand twist, or a Left-Hand twist.  The model grew out of that simple idea. <br><br> I was also trying to imagine a way to stuff the curvature of a 3 D sine wave into subatomic particles.<br>.",@SpotterVideo,0.0,2023-09-20T19:11:57Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

I agree whole-heartedly with Eric and I will explain in my own words how:  so many people want things in a nutshell. Certain people have done the long, hard work and then others come in and say give me an easy explanation -  give me the overview in the least amount of words. Many things cannot be understood that way. For one thing you definitely must know the terminology, the language. That will go a long way to helping you understand the concepts. And one concept builds on another. And it is really cheating if you always want something in a nutshell. Having an explanation in a nutshell is helpful for the purpose of learning more and not just stopping at that point.",@tjtampa214,3.0,2023-09-13T04:21:40Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman
vdW9XDBuxjU,UgwTQ-pN8PVxdvEf56V4AaABAg,"The theory of everything:    The math problem answer, to the Theory of Everything = 1.  No I don’t know what the formula is but that’s the answer.  To find the formula all you have to do is turn around and figure out what 1, actually is.  If you’re not representing the answer correctly as a human, then you’ll never find the formula.  Now everyone go think about one and what it represents until you figure out what that formula is.  Go meditate about one.  You are riding on one underlying base frequency and its harmonics.  So within the confines of what you’ve told me, you have to go back and combine everything back together until you figure out exactly what that means.   This is me trying to explain to you within the confines of what you’ve been able to teach me.  So far I haven’t been on the world to go past what you’ve taught me to explain things.  if I become that smart, that would be amazing because then I would be up with Albert Einstein and the rest but I’m not there. LOL <br><br>Here is part of my proof.  When do things work the best, when they are combined as a group going in the same direction as one.  That doesn’t matter if it’s a laserbeam or a society of people.  The answer is one. <br><br>Part of this may be when you learn to control time all energy is also realigned into the same phase and now you have an infinite amount of power.  Realign the energy in phase and direction and all of a sudden you have more than what you need : ). All you have to do is learn how to stop time and then capture the energy to maintain the process. You don’t need to blow anything up and generate huge amounts of heat because the energy is already out there being generated so you just have to learn how to stop time to capture it in the most efficient manner. If there is no time there can’t be a phase shifts, which naturally realign everything.  Remember, all you have to do is create an opposite reaction to what’s happening right now to stop time.  You should be able to do that with an energy field.  I don’t think it has to be a very big energy field either. As long as you have something to start collecting the energy once you stop time at the collection area, you can then use that power to create a larger time dilation in front of the sensor, so it self regulates. time is related to our position and movement in space so all we have to do is negate that in a tiny area with a sensor that can collect the energy<br><br>You can come and try to hit me on the head a couple of times and see if the station comes in clear but so far I haven’t gotten anything to work : ).

You are probably the nicest most open-minded and fair and honest person on YouTube and perhaps one of the most of these things in a person in the world, but I know that you are very very you don&#39;t have time to listen to every wackadoodle don&#39;t want to talk to you about his own personal Theory or idea. Well it might be a good thing to talk to this wackadoodle at least give me a little bit of advice and criticism but that would mean you here in my entire idea from beginning to the end which is basically kind of a mixture between sir Rodger Penrose is theory of geometric conformal replication or something like that and perhaps Eric Weinstein&#39;s theor as it seems to involve geometry. Yeah I&#39;ve only listen to a video of him explaining it and detail once and I fell asleep about halfway through so I missed the whole thing basically. I&#39;m not exactly sure what it&#39;s about and there&#39;s a lot of technical talk in there that I&#39;m not familiar with since I&#39;m not a physicist or mathematician and as you know if you don&#39;t understand the structure of an equation or what the operations are it doesn&#39;t matter how smart you are, the stuff that you were looking at looks like gibberish and when someone is describing anything or Nigeria using the technical terms that probably everyone in the lecture hall are most of the audience actually understand if they are a mathematician or physicist or a biologist in some cases or just finished high school and did some basic University mathematics. See I&#39;m the guy that knows a lot about the higher-level mathematics or actually you would call it the foundational mathematics because I believe they teach math kind of backwards. I&#39;ll tell you what when I was in 3rd or 4th grade doing long division and 7th or 8th grade doing beginning algebra it would have helped my grades and my desire to learn math infinitely if they would have been teaching about number Theory set theory Infinity and Kurt Godel because after the 20th time doing a long division problem or an algebra equation I was like I did it I did it already and I did I didn&#39;t mean to keep repeating it cuz I&#39;m one of those people that learn it completely by the second time usually. So I would actually skipped school to go learned on my own or read books about physics and math and other things like metaphysic philosophy and comparative religion and mythology as well. So I see things outside the box that many people from either side of the materialist their ideologist Camp might miss because I see the logic and wisdom in both places and can make a whole out of it. Anyways my Siri is pretty much logically sound from beginning to the end it just lacks some of the technical terms that need to be figured in so I could create equations and proof. In fact I might need a whole new number line kind of like when they invented complicated numbers or whatever they&#39;re called. I forget which one it is but it&#39;s like imaginary numbers and stuff like that. It&#39;s off the number line from the real numbers and integers kind of sideways to it. Also there are some functions and values that I need to figure in but I know that the connections I make or completely logically sound from beginning to the end kind of like Aristotelian logic says to do. It&#39;s how any metaphysical idea is conceived in the first place which is by starting at an empirical approvable beginning point in moving in slow easy steps that are all logically sound and can be proven because the logic alone although there might not be the material or the place to do a concrete or empirical experiment but nonetheless they must be true because of logic. Geometric fractals like a strange Loop in nature that shows the eternal cycles of creation. Every part of the equation I have accounted for and it all leads to other things that are fundamental and mandatory for existence which is basically the concept of nothingness and the mind that is there to conceive it because that is the only place where these things can be created or understood. Basically it&#39;s a theory of information that treats the data information itself as thoughts because that&#39;s all they are otherwise why would they be encoded in such a way to carry meaning if there wasn&#39;t something there that could understand it and how would they have been created in the first place unless it was created by a person or mind or universe that knew what it meant? Basically all information is thoughts and the language that is spoken in the same language we are fluent in just by the way we can perceive our existence with our senses. That is our way of interpreting the language of a creation. Now substitute god with Universe keeping in mind what uni means and that we are all part of it and then start at the beginning where paradox causes all things to come into being because of the fact that absolute nothingness is an impossibility, it&#39;s a logical impossibility. Is literally impossible for exist because the information that comes with anything that exists would also be there and even absolute nothingness must have a definition or a name or a label or something that describes it no matter what. Although it is supposed to be absolutely nothing at all that right there is information what I just said. This means that something must have the information describing it existing for it to exist itself that means it is actually something and not nothing and this is the point of paradox because everything that come into being because since it is something and not nothing that means it is everything and since it is everything that means it is also infinite. The only thing is it is part of larger than infinity it is the infinite of all infinities are the Omega Infinity because all things in existence all existence has included are contained by only one thing and that is nothing is so that means it is far larger and there&#39;s far more data to describe it needed and sent this is a duality we are in where everything is either left or right up or down good or bad and the only two parts of this Duality are nothingness and infinity there is an infinite abundance of extra data so when nothing is get turned into Data or information and that is the infinite half the rest of it which is infinitely more than infinity but also go somewhere and that is where the data starts creating time and space and matter and energy. If you&#39;re interested in helping me just answer this post and I&#39;ll send you more details and more edited and more logical explanation like to see if Eric was interested as well thank you much love and respect to you and thank you for everything you&#39;re doing.

rIAZJNe7YtE,Ugwck1VAd5wXCr2InTB4AaABAg,"This CD has three separate relaxation/meditation sessions on it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzpa8CIfZcihW4Z0F_ja0QF3W9KIatrsq"">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxzpa8CIfZcihW4Z0F_ja0QF3W9KIatrsq</a> guided by a very pleasant and direct male voice. Unlike so many other products of its type, this CD does not have bad synthesizer music, does not feature a phony or affected style of narration, and does not make any bogus claims to be  subliminal  or to  re-train the brain  or any of that balderdash. What you get is 1. a guided meditation for getting into a pleasantly relaxed state of body awareness while taking a stroll (superb for those easing back into a fitness routine slowly after an illness or injury) 2. A nice long breath-awareness relaxation session that if followed diligently can put you into very deep states of full-body relaxation and mental calmness, and 3. a buddhist-inspired meditation session designed to help you develop and maintain feelings of loving kindness toward not just yourself and your friends, but toward people you don&#39;t even like. The CD makes no claims to be designed for advanced meditators or for buddhists or hindus/yoga practitioners looking for very deep and esoteric stuff. It is geared more toward the average person who just wants to develop the habit of relaxation and stress relief through natural, healthy means. him, if you happen to be reading this, keep up the good work fella, and I love your accent. I would also like to note that I have never fallen asleep while listening to this product. I would like to kindly suggest to the reviewer who said this CD makes him fall asleep, that he might want to get checked to see if he has a sleep disorder, or if he is simply not setting aside ample time for restful sleep at night. A healthy person getting adequate rest at night should be able to go into deep states of mental relaxation without dozing off, if not all the time, then most of the time.",@luvyanks4ever,195.0,2023-06-08T04:31:07Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

rIAZJNe7YtE,UgwSEtOBGCDgSCxwMKN4AaABAg,"People are made of cells. Cells contain DNA. DNA is made up of molecules. Molecules are made up of chemical elements. Chemical elements are atoms. Atoms have a nucleus made up of one or more positively charged Protons, zero or more neutrally charged Neutrons, and zero or more positively charged Electrons (normally the same numbers as there are Protons), so a single Atom of Hydrogen gas is one Electron orbiting one Proton with no Neutrons, meanwhile a single Atom of Gold has 79 Electrons and 79 Protons and 118 Neutrons. Now there was a mystery in physics which was &quot;Why do atoms with multiple positively charged Protons stay glued together when their Protons should repel each other apart?&quot;<br><br>This led to the assumption that there must be some new force of nature gluing Protons together. Later experiments revealed that Protons were made up of three Quarks held together by gluons. Neutrons were made up of three Quarks held together by gluons too. The gluons were responsible for keeping the atomic nucleus together. The way gluons operate is governed by something called the Strong force.<br><br>Actually, there are only two types of Quark inside most atoms. There are Up Quarks and Down Quarks. That&#39;s it. Very simple.<br><br>So you have an Electron with an electric charge of -1<br><br>Then you have an Up Quark with an electric charge of +2/3<br>Then you have a Down Quark with an electric charge of -1/3<br><br>Therefore, a Neutron is +2/3 + -1/3 + -1/3 = 0 charge<br>and a Proton is simply +2/3 + +2/3 + -1/3 = +1 charge<br><br>Elegant, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>So all atoms in the Periodic table are made of Up and Down Quarks held together by gluons with Electrons orbiting them. Those atoms then connect into molecules and can form things like DNA which allows life to replicate itself and grow cells to make new people to make and watch podcasts and comment under the video. These quarks are called elementary particles, and they can&#39;t be divided into anything more primitive.<br><br>However, particles can be thought of as waves. However, both models of reality are misleading as they are actually fields that are spread out everywhere and interact with each other, and sometimes those interactions seem wave like, and other times they seem like point particles moving around.<br><br>Eric Weinstein is saying that there is just a single unified field named omega which interacts with itself in fourteen dimensions to produce relativistic waves, some aspect of which are determined via interaction with the engine of observation that is gravity - i.e. the &quot;curvature&quot; of our readily accessible four dimensional spacetime.<br><br><i>Geometric </i><b><i>Unity</i></b> is a speculative work in progress that aspires to be a Unified Field Theory and a potential future candidate for what a Theory of Everything might look like. It is not yet either. It does not describe itself as a Theory in his incomplete draft paper. Lex described it as a Theory of Everything, which is a misrepresentation of where Eric Weinstein has got with it thus far. It may become a candidate for a Theory of Everything at some point in the future, but it might take several years more work. It is hard to say &quot;How long?&quot; with these things as Albert Einstein worked on his Unified Field Theory at Princeton University for the last thirty years of his life and was unable to solve the problem.<br><br>Eric Weinstein thinks that the problem can be solved by unifying the almost incompatible types of geometry which underlie both <i>Quantum Field Theory</i> and <i>General Relativity.</i> Here, <i>Quantum Field Theory</i> is based on the geometry of Charles Ehresmann. <i>General Relativity</i> is based on the geometry of Bernhard Riemann. These geometries can be made to work by the construction of a kind of bridge between both geometries, that Eric Weinstein calls a Chimeric fiber bundle as, like the mythical Chimera that has the head of a lion and tail of a snake, Eric needs to find a way to join the fourteen dimensional Ehresmannian surface where omega lives with the four dimensional Riemannian spacetime where we live.<br><br>Hence, Geometric Unity.<br><br>Then you have a single field omega &#39;pulled back&#39; through this Chimeric fiber bundle so that some aspects of this field manifest as phenomena in our four dimensional Universe, like quarks and electrons (i.e. Fermions) and gluons (i.e. Bosons). I&#39;m leaving out a lot of detail, so you may want to read my longer comments on my video:<br><br><i>Geometric </i><b><i>Unity</i></b> explained in under 2 minutes<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVlDoR_EMPg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVlDoR_EMPg</a>",@____uncompetative,1.0,2023-03-07T12:07:38Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

It meant that humanity could somehow defeat software by innovation, unexpected calculation and &quot;kiai (fighting spirit)&quot;. We lived in simpler times, and most people playing go started in their teens and some have developed into really high quality players. In effect, the complexity of the game&#39;s patterns makes it that by sheer dedication a 15 year old nerd in 2005 like myself could beat a 45 year old who wasn&#39;t concerned by the patterns of the fuseki and josekis. <br><br>And you could ask anyone of the go community how they felt about Alpha Go&#39;s victories over Lee Seedol and people will probably not talk to you about the AI optimization. They will tell you something else... The word you will hear will be: &quot;I felt sad&quot;. And then if you ask them about game 4, they will tell you &quot;I felt hope&#39;. Ultimately humanity does have the intellect, the potential, the pattern recognition, the ability to create arts and to give meaning to things. And al of those considered, I think robots might somehow be better at all of those one day... Except one thing that they will never outmatch us in: the beauty of the human emotion. We will win that game a 100 times out of a 100, regardless of the source code or optimization. :))",@m4r_art,0.0,2020-04-05T02:31:25Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman
e77NkSjnyH4,UgwBGbH01uQRC7-iQNZ4AaABAg,"Thanks. This is teaching us a lot about intelligence - &quot;if then else&quot; statements (one off programs), &quot;Monte Carlo, Tree Searches&quot; (Deep Blue), &quot;Learning from experts&quot; (AlphaGo), Learning with no previous knowledge (Alpha Zero) and Learning  knowing even no rules (NewZero).  Amazing, and I now understand how the progression is actually removing the inbuilt limits inherent in each approach with the &quot;final&quot; answer being that the AI has to be able to work out everything for itself without prompting.  Amazing! Being a very modest Chess player I found it difficult to appreciate the staggering achievement of AlphaZero, that only knowing the rules it was able via self-play to effectively uncover the knowledge in Modern Chess Openings in a few hours.  Looking at the commentaries, for example, on its games against Stockfish you would hear such as, &quot;it now chooses the Dragon variation of the Sicilian&quot; but the wonderful thing is that it didn&#39;t get that out of a database, it worked it out for itself! It cloned human knowledge of 2000 years in a few hours. Thanks David and Lex.",@keitho9508,16.0,2020-04-05T00:26:29Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

When someone is put to sleep I think it is wrong to say they loose consciousness. I don&#39;t think that is the correct use of the word &#39;consciousness&#39;. I see consciousness as a vastly many varied state. It&#39;s the <b>amount</b> of consciousness that is of concern when someone is put to sleep. I say they are still conscious when so-called unconscious, it&#39;s just that they are not <b>as</b> conscious as they were when their brain was taking note of all the data coming in from their senses. I think the proper use of the word &#39;unconscious&#39; is that it means dead. <br><br>I believe computers, or rather human-made computers, experience consciousness because I see consciousness as being data. The act of using data <b>is</b> consciousness i.e. this is what it is like to be a working human brain. Every part of consciousness <b>is</b> data. To <b>be</b> conscious is to be conscious <b>of</b> something, in other words to have data of that something. To be unconscious is to be conscious of nothing i.e. dead. When you are &#39;unconscious&#39; (in the present use of the word) your brain is still using data, it is still conscious of something, it&#39;s just not conscious of the outside world, and in the case of anaesthesia, not conscious of pain. That&#39;s why I say consciousness is a vastly many varied state. To understand the consciousness of anything, be it a fox, a bee, an ant ..... a laptop .... you have to ask the question &#39;What is it conscious of?&#39; i.e. &#39;What does it have the data of?&#39;. <br><br>I understand that a human brain is bound to be very different to a human-made computer brain. Of course it will be, it has evolved over millions of years, we grow from seed, we have a childhood, we have needs, we are made from flesh and bone. A human-made brain is made from silicon and metal, has no needs, or at least does not know it has needs, does not have a childhood, it is completely different ... BUT ... do those differences mean it is not conscious? Does the fact that the human brain has these microtubules mean that it is therefore conscious and the human-made brain is not?

For the next layer, let&#39;s look at 2nd law of thermodynamics. It&#39;s purpose to increase entropy. What if the evolution is just a mechanism (a sub goal) in order to increase entropy further? Evolution&#39;s goal is how to reproduce efficiently. In other words how to spread energy efficiently.

What was that latent variable everyone talked about in every topic of ML. I surely did not find those answers in any tutorial except that they were approximating a function. But made that function work, what was the logic, it was always a black hole. I spent a lot of time just thinking about what the hell was this latent space of VAE?i saw maths of matrix multiplication bur absolutely no intution what was that latent space. However, i came upon transfomer like idea much before reading these topics. But, whatever i read in ML, this idea was always counter intuitive to what i thought should be.. So, i thought my understanding must be rubbish to the way it works. I understood what those weights in DL were but never could not understand why it was always intialized to 0 or with some  hyper-parameter. search. But, all were giving absolutely no intuitions the current deep learning material was taught. Here, only thing helps is how you view things or perceive which is the uniqueness of super smart people i have listenedt to. They always struggle witj ideas which are counter intuitive and hence their learning is slow with taught material and often are not grade a+ of their class because their ideas may be better but simply not accepted.",@pratik245,0.0,2021-12-23T05:08:28Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

8aVB5xgCllY,Ugxfpi5fN_hzdS7QXpB4AaABAg,"I agree with the warning. I&#39;ve experienced this myself. At one point in my life I had a girlfriend. Any time when I&#39;d bounce an idea off with her it was met with criticism. I know that my ideas have holes and that they are very open to critique, but it drains the life out of someone when you hear criticism every time and never some positive reinforcement. The idea was that she&#39;d give criticism in order to improve the idea, but whenever I listened to her tone, I never got the idea that it got conveyed in that way. There was some miscommunication on how her criticism was meant to be taken. I also didn&#39;t always experience the criticism as constructive (sometimes I did experience it that way). Ultimately, I stopped telling her my ideas, but my spirit got drained.<br><br>Contrast this to an entrepreneurial friend of mine. The first thing he did was build on the merits of the idea. And I think that&#39;s what you should do. Because when I think about any FAANG company, I could should down all of those ideas with a similar style of criticism that my girlfriend from back in the day used.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t only her. It was also people that I looked up to and listened to. The people that I looked up to were wealthy, smart and kind but quite conservative (financially speaking, not politically speaking, and in their position they should be financially conservative). So I got financial conservatism 101 advice. Rationally, it&#39;s sound advice. But in retrospect it fucked with my emotions and I simply wasted a year applying to jobs. I wasted a year because I put the bar high but only have 60 to 80% of my soul in it. <br><br>That sounds like a lot, but when you put 100% of your soul into something, then crazy shit happens. Stuff like: you&#39;re breaking your own scale and now the 60 to 80% of yesteryear is now 30 to 40% when you&#39;re looking at your new scale. Or you get energy from what you do instead that it takes energy. I find working on stuff that takes energy amazing as it teaches me something about life and it builds a form of character. But a person is so much more productive if what that person does <b>gives</b> energy instead of taking it.<br><br>I agree with the warning, mostly. As you can see, I had a friend who definitely helped with his advice. But most people didn&#39;t help.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if you should follow your passion though, because while all of this is amazing, I&#39;ve seen 2 caveats:<br>- Amazing musicians who lived below the poverty line. It&#39;s nice to make music but they were rationing their meals.<br>- Horribile musicians who thought they were amazing and lived a 100% for music. You see them come by on music competition shows.<br><br>So I think with this advice some simple economic theory should be in order. Are you in a winner takes all market, or in a more egalitarian market (i.e. programming)? Do you care about not eating every day? In other words: what are your financial needs? Also, how much are you willing to sacrifice? Following your passion may mean not seeing your family, friends and significant other for a long time. It could also mean that you get to see them more and be more connected (it really depends on what you&#39;re passionate about), but to my understanding: Einstein, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk had or are having issues in this department.<br><br>Finally, this message is too easy. The word &quot;passion&quot; biases us to &quot;follow your passion&quot;. Which implies to follow one thing. That&#39;s easy to remember. But what if you want to balance 5 things? Why not have a more nuanced discussion on balancing multiple areas of life? Also, there is a darkside of passion. I&#39;ve already stated a potential social darkside, but your health as well. When I&#39;m passionate, I can&#39;t sleep because my mind races about the thing I&#39;m passionate about. I ignore all else, it&#39;s like drugs except I&#39;m being productive and creating somekind of app just for the sake of it. Is that really what you want your life to be like? I mean, I thoroughly enjoyed the moments I&#39;ve been passionately working on my computer graphics engine in 2012, <a href=""http://doodledocs.com/"">doodledocs.com</a> in 2019 and hacking on <a href=""http://hackethebox.eu/"">hackethebox.eu</a> in 2020. But I haven&#39;t spoken to people in those months as well, I averaged 5 to 6 hours of sleep per day, had horrible exercise and eating habits. I could&#39;ve done better at that but it&#39;s hard since I&#39;m not passionate about exercise or healthy eating, I like it, but when I&#39;m passionate then everything else has to move.<br><br>I think a warning on &quot;live your life with passion&quot; with the above comments should be stated as well.",@melvin6228,33.0,2020-04-02T13:45:22Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Could it not be conceivable that the premise that, there must be something beyond that fabric of consciousness in order for It to exist be invalid? (Irreducible Factor)  Would it not be potentially logical for there to be a dimension consisting of an infinite, spiritual fabric of internal consciousness that is irreducible and that is responsible for reality? <br><br> In my search for answers for forty years in the field of metaphysics, it was necessary to analyze the action of Nature as we experience it in the physical world, on a moment-to-moment basis, and then, deduce it to the inner dimensions of existence, to the point of origin.

XRpKisty1EU,Ugzips0EJpo60cPU7XZ4AaABAg,"I&#39;m sure this comment will ruffle a few feathers, but really have to wonder if doing philosophy should be a full-time occupation that anyone should pursue. Consider the periods in which philosophy as a wholistic discipline really bloomed, let&#39;s say as represented by the ancient medieval and early modern period. People like Plato and Aristotle were early enough so that they could theorize about the nature of the universe without having to become specialists in multiple fields; people like Thomas Aquinas had a vocational duty to begin to try to put together a holistic view of reality; finally, somebody like Immanuel Kant could use a fully formulated Newtonian physics as a model. But we now live in an age in which holistic thinking seems better realized as The outcome of speculation done by people within the individual disciplines. That conflicts with the way that philosophy has evolved as a discipline in it&#39;s own right – as one that requires a great deal of specialization, without requiring any actual real knowledge of fields outside it&#39;s on discipline. That leaves the philosopher without much to talk about except developments in various arguments that are carried on by philosophers, but that lack a feeling of relevance simply because it has become more and more of an isolated discipline in line with the specialization in academic disciplines surrounding it. There&#39;s some thing that doesn&#39;t feel quite comfortable about working Day after day within a field that isn&#39;t rooted in anything by the development of its own speculative arguments. But If physicists for example could take over to a greater extent the tools and arguments of philosophers that apply to their field, then they would be the ones to be in the best position to draw those conclusions. They do of course already do that to some extent, but a professional philosopher can always find places where they overlooked something. For the individual philosopher it must feel somewhat alienating, isolating, and maybe even a little bit fraudulent in some sense to spend all their time in  a field whose subject matter forces them to look to places other disciplines can&#39;t quite claim and make a daily preoccupation out of them. To me, the guest&#39;s demeanor seems like A reflection of that basic problem inherent in the discipline of philosophy. The question of whether this is important and why has to be raised at all points. Such preoccupations seem sitting for someone such as a novelist or for a physicist or a computer scientist who is thinking about these things as a sideline to their main work, but there&#39;s something odd about someone having to exert themselves consistently to become an expert on such issues. Yet the evolution of the discipline demands it.",@arlieferguson3990,1.0,2020-03-29T19:03:01Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

There’s a dark place in our minds where we can get stuck in this yucky goo of hopelessness if we stray too far from idealism, or having hope... I don’t believe it should be a forbidden place that’s totally off-limits (it’s got a beauty of its own, the darkness, and can be a very tempting place), the problem is staying there too long. I’ve been in many predicaments where I just come to an impasse, and totally ready to accept a sense of hopelessness (which I think can bring entitlement in along with it too), when someone else comes along displaying a different outlook by seeing things optimistically, and boom! It was all I needed to shift my perspective. Then I can remember that all things change in time, and since there are endless possibilities to assist that change, there’s a more than likely chance that I haven’t vetted them all. Seeing the confidence lying within someone’s optimism when we’re stuck and not seeing a way out is a beautiful &amp; very helpful thing, it can mean a world of difference.

I loved the novels, “The Idiot” and “The Brothers Karamazov”, the characters that Dostoevsky created, and the intensity with which they pursued their reward functions.  I would also recommend Tarkovsky’s film “Andrei Rublev.”<br><br>2.	Passion is a word that originally meant “to suffer”, and now it also means to feel something with intense emotion.  When the Europeans searched for greater meaning in religion they sought it in passion, from the followers of Bacchus in Ancient Greece, to the self-torturing Christian medieval monks.  On the other hand, practitioners of many Asian religions, especially in forms of Buddhism, searched for greater meaning in the opposite direction, in detachment with awareness.  Why is it that humans find profound meaning--in work, religion, philosophy, art, and maybe even romance--in these two apparently opposite directions? <br><br>Thank you.  William L.

_TTNGq9djU4,UgyKcIOyED_vFxd1M6h4AaABAg,"Lex, I am really enjoying your channel. These are worrying times, and deep conversation is more important than ever. However, I am very disturbed and even disgusted with your constant pushing of suffering as an aesthetic ideal. I also come from an ex-USSR Jewish family, and I know exactly what you mean when you talk about yourself and your background. You strike me as a bit oversocialized into the Russian cult of thinking that romanticizes suffering and delights in wallowing in it and even increasing it out a need for &quot;depth&quot;. Increasing suffering is the one and only true evil in this world, no matter how beautiful that suffering may be to ponder from a safe distance. Life gives all of us either enough or more than enough suffering. We should be struggling to improve our lives and the lives of others, not fetishizing pain out of a snobbish desire for &quot;insight&quot;. There is enough suffering in the world already, but the way you talk about it, it sounds like you don&#39;t truly realize that. Not everything Russian culture says is good. The beautiful and positive contributions of that country to world culture do not in any way justify the cult of suffering that is ever-present in those contributions.",@danielkonstantinovsky108,0.0,2020-10-25T20:30:08Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

_TTNGq9djU4,UgzM3EPZLqIPz8eKRuh4AaABAg,"Enjoyed the passion/hardwork debate. I think if you&#39;re lucky enough for your passion to align with your work, and you own your work, have agency, then sacrificing sleep and comforts for it, though physiology will have limits and eventually diminishing returns, can feel optimal to the individual. For most people however this is probably not the case. It&#39;s easy to have passion when you&#39;re building your own company, when it&#39;s your prototype, when you&#39;re in control. Can founders/CEOs cultivate a passion in their employees to match their own? The &#39;better world&#39; motivation is an interesting argument, can certainly be very positive but also may be misused, on it&#39;s own it&#39;s still missing that individual agency/ownership element, some personality types need it more than others but all do to some degree. In general, you need to look at external and internal motivation distinctions and their variability among people, there is probably no one answer fits all strategy.",@_etranger9500,2.0,2020-03-22T06:53:22Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

8bt6r6CIghw,Ugzz0OxAJ7adhAB_vKR4AaABAg,"A lot has changed since this interview. We&#39;re getting to a point where neural networks actually begin to develop genuine &quot;understanding&quot;, because similar concepts are located near to each other within a multidimensional vector space. This is true for large language models, acoustic patterns, picture elements/visual objects, etc.. The problem is that all this &quot;understanding&quot; happens only within the realm that the model has been trained on, e.g. only language-based. Us humans perceive the world through a multitude of sensory patterns that share associations. An object like &quot;dog&quot; can e.g. have a look, a smell, a touch and make a sound, etc.. Current AI models usually are not exactly stupid, but just extremely handicapped (blind, deaf, mute...) because they are lacking many of the possible sensory inputs. True understanding would imply at least some understanding of representations of concepts in the physical world. Something like GPT3 &quot;understands&quot; that red is a category that is similar to blue or green, but it has only &quot;heard&quot; the words, but not &quot;seen&quot; them. Something like DALL-E on the other hand &quot;understands&quot; nothing but colored pixels. It&#39;s just a different handicap. Things really get exciting once AI becomes truly multimodal and starts to discover associations between various types of inputs. Such an AI could actually become &quot;superhuman&quot; by being augmented by various additional sensory modalities that humans don&#39;t have.",@___Chris___,3.0,2023-03-11T13:06:26Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

8bt6r6CIghw,UgwRJD6mPloXqxtjj4h4AaABAg,"I believe Biological and Artificial will come together in a virtual 4D world that mimics the biological/physical/Artificial world together. And only then, the AI Neural Network will power a True AI. With virtual AI codes generated in a computer will bypass the limitations of physical computations. When I write code to create applications that never fails, I code in a form of a dream state, in witch the possibilities are endless to create solid applications that never fails. I think first in how a biological functions works and then write the code based on that. Nature had around 17,000 years to code and why not look into it&#39;s arrays of variables that became void or transformed.  So, the future of AI in my opinion is the future of today&#39;s biological dna, meaning the AI will be the missing transformation that nature could not code or will never code. It also could be, that Humans were designed to create Artificial Neural Networks so the Biological work never vanish over the years to come. We could be in the beginning of the end of the biological matter as we know. The digital age just started and things could be transformed in few years to a state of digital world when the biological world will become used as simple matter to produce energy. Yes, the future of AI and Biological is on how can we generate energy to process all the Artificial Neurons. The first company or organization that decode the power that will power the digital age will be the key for the future of human kind and migration.

WgLo4gmEraU,UgxP1u-qD7tqLKyiIpp4AaABAg,"The following argument based on recent experiments shows that the Pilot Wave deterministic interpretation of quantum Mechanics is the correct interpretation. Experiments and electrodynamic theory have proven that nearfield electromagnetic fields (Light) are instantaneous and this has consequences for all of modern physics including quantum mechanics. See links below for details. And the reality of instantaneous nearfield electromagnetic fields (group speed and front speed) can be explained by quantum mechanics using the Pilot Wave interpretation of quantum mechanics and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP), where Δx and Δp are interpreted as averages, and not the uncertainty in the values as in other interpretations of quantum mechanics. So in HUP: Δx Δp = h, where Δp=mΔv, thus HUP becomes: Δx Δv = h/m.  In the nearfield where the field is created, Δx=0, therefore Δv=infinity. In the farfield, HUP: Δx Δp = h, where p = h/λ. HUP then becomes: Δx  h/λ = h, or Δx=λ. Also in the farfield HUP becomes: λmΔv=h, thus Δv=h/(mλ). Since p=h/λ, then Δv=p/m. Also since p=mc, then Δv=c. So in summary, in the nearfield Δv=infinity, and in the farfield  Δv=c, where Δv is the average velocity of the photon according to Pilot Wave theory. See the video and papers below for details and for more information about how the reality of instantaneous nearfield light affects other areas of modern physics.<br><br>Dr. William Walker - PhD ETH Zurich, 1997<br><br>*YouTube presentation of above arguments:<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePdJ7vSQvQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePdJ7vSQvQ&amp;t=0s</a> &lt;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePdJ7vSQvQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePdJ7vSQvQ&amp;t=0s&gt;</a><br><br>*More extensive paper for the above arguments:<br>William D.

Some engineer then put wheels on the bags when people started carrying their own luggage.

We had a phone, it was stuck to the wall, then it became portable, then it had more features (camera, dictation, integration applications) thus instead of carrying (or wheeling) several devices, you only need 1.

WgLo4gmEraU,UgzHovJpwGHpJsgJ8_54AaABAg,"Lee and Lex, Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematic, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. The Mathematics that we have today can&#39;t solve  the problem of quantum gravitation.<br> <br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity.<br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that my new mathematics has derived: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1.

Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement.

WgLo4gmEraU,Ugy7oK4VveWhd3et3Hh4AaABAg,"Lee and Lex, Quantum Gravity is real as Quantum Anti-Gravity and Quantum Neutral Gravity.  We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that paves the way for the Theory of Everything in Physics, that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical laws and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise, quantum computational and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement in Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity.

Like Socrates, &#39;consciousness&#39; arose as the &#39;spirit-matter&#39; duality synthesized. Consciousness comes to interpret reality (ontology) through perception and storytelling (epistemology). Influential people then use epistemology to effect ontology by way of rhetoric. Today we live in a world almost entirely shaped by the stories we tell ourselves. Such stories are very real and have tremendous impact on us and the natural world -- threatening even our extinction. Such an extinction would be a time when humanity no longer shapes reality through rhetoric, epistemology ceases, and what&#39;s left of ontology is entirely natural -- though much diminished.

The context didn&#39;t make it clear that variable gravity was involved, but maybe I should have noted that variable gravity must be the default in cosmology. Eventually it became apparent to me that lightspeed could be gravity sensitive, that it gravitationally speeds up to gravitationally blueshift. After that, what Van Flandern said made perfect sense to me, he was talking about the same photon under different gravities. The only argument against variable light speed involves a braindead flatworm creation of bent-space fans, a theoretical light decay, as if light and gravity cannot exchange energies directly.",@CACBCCCU,0.0,2022-04-12T12:07:20Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

You recall inundation with countless Einstein Sunday news stories on smaller eyeballs and faster clocks making blue turn greenish, or worse. Thus: A) Gravity shift made length and time metrics shift. B) Gravity shift made lightspeed shift. C) keep time reliant on frequency counts needing frequent resets.<br><br>General Relativity basics for light: Special Relativity&#39;s Perfectly Flat Everlasting &quot;c&quot; bends everything for more simplicity:<br><br>Using GR, you can measure distance with light by counting wavelengths of a known frequency (X wave-cycles/meter) and measure time with light by counting oscillations of a known frequency (Y wave-cycles/second). Supposing speed of light is constant, blue-shifted light&#39;s faster oscillation rate means time rate is faster, while a fixed count of its shorter wave cycles defines shorter meters. Faster seconds and shorter meters allow blue-shifted light to cover a constant number of meters per second.  <br><br>Faster light is not the same as faster seconds or slower seconds: <br><br>When space is laterally stretched more on the inward side of a mass, what drives light toward mass more than away? Best answer is GR, a model where stretchable space fabric gets conveniently pulled down by gravity pushing on top of it like a heavy complicated theoretically entropy-maximizing fragile gradual Hawking information-whistling butt-plug of a national treasure. When light is faster on the inward side of a mass, what pulls light inward faster? Sigh.

Wheels were not put on luggage because, in fact, it was not practical to do so with the materials and manufacturing technologies of the time. It was far more practical and cost-effective to put the wheels on carts and dolly&#39;s so those wheels could be re-used many many times for many pieces of luggage in the situations where wheels were most needed. Also keep in mind that wheels affixed to a piece of luggage are not useful unless the luggage also has a long handle. And a long handle is not practical until it is collapsible in some way. And before plastics and other materials and manufacturing methods for lightweight but sufficiently strong parts, the wheels and handles would have added too much bulk and weight to a piece of luggage.<br><br>Also, you can bet that many people thought of putting wheels on luggage long before the commonplace versions we see today.

WgLo4gmEraU,UgxpAk3nmWQUbTlEGtR4AaABAg,"String theory doesn&#39;t seem to be a contender for a quantum gravity theory because a quantum gravity theory has to answer the question:  what is spacetime made of?  Twistor theory is the closest to answering &quot;what is spacetime made of&quot;.  But it falls short because &quot;twisters&quot; cannot be experimentally detected or isolated.  It is the same situation with Loop Quantum Gravity.  Those loops cannot be isolated either.  But it is worse than that.  Neither of those theories are compatible with big bang expansion.  You would expect that, whatever spacetime is made of, that such &quot;atoms of spacetime&quot; require an &quot;expansion&quot; parameter because the big bang &quot;expanded&quot; from a point.<br><br>Someone needs to come up with a quantum gravity theory that answers the question:  what is spacetime made of/what are the atoms of spacetime.  I would suggest calling it, the Expanding Graviton.  The Expanding Graviton has three primary characteristics.  1) Expanding Gravitons are the carriers of the physics constants.  2) Expanding Gravitons are equivalent to wave functions; thus wave functions and their operators are real things; and now they are a manifestation of gravitons.  3) Expanding gravitons expand spherically, at the speed of light, with radius r = ct.  Where in physics have we seen something that looks like an expanding sphere?  Two places.  First, the derivation of time dilation.  Second, two slit interference pattern.  <br><br>A proper quantum gravity theory should have an experiment associated with it.  I would suggest that quantum entanglements between photons, are (Captured) Gravitons; it&#39;s not really an Expanding Graviton if it is captured between two photons whose positions can be controlled with optical fiber, lenses, mirrors, etc.  I would also comment that it takes a tiny amount of energy to capture a graviton; if you add up all of the gravitons in the universe, then that number of gravitons multiplied by the capture energy of a graviton should equal DARK ENERGY.

So, seeing for yourself removes all this social pressure problems, because you see the evidence for yourself. Not just blindly adopting the evidence just cause its been imposed by authority. Part of the scientific method is to verify the results experiments by seeing the results for yourself.",@biggboi1025,0.0,2021-02-21T20:02:30Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

I ask this what would you have done if you were the creator of the first sentient beings with free will in the physical side of the universe?<br> The beings you created had a limited ability of foresight, and also had the ability to go extinct without your giudance or direction, the only real way to give full free will was to put something in the start of the paradise that represented your guidance and &quot;knowledge&quot; of good or bad choices on future outcomes, them eating of it was them saying they wanted to try governing themselves with out the creators guidance representing the full &quot;knowing&quot; of good and bad choices, there was also a entity from the non physical universe that agreed with the humans governing themselves because it wanted to do the same.  The creator allowed this rebellion to take place to let these questions be answered, he did not hate his creation but needed to now allow this question to be fully answered, what kind of governments would humans come up with, what would results be? This could not be fully tested or answered if you as the creator didn&#39;t take away all of the affects of your guidance or governance along with all of its subsidies (which may have included: longer or immortal life, weather control, abundance, choice projections etc.)<br>In my opinion this is why we see many bad outcomes today and even some of the good. Most religious people actually disagree with this thinking because they say God creator is in control....no he is not human are in control for good and bad. And there is a group of beings in non physical dimension that are also doing the same. If the creator was still in control the &quot;prison as you called it would be planet wide by now And it would be an extension of the prison/paridise&quot;.  If you were the creator of this reality how would you have done differently,how would you handle an emerging rebellion calling for full independence on two fronts both in the physical dimension and the non physical dimesion (2nd or 3rd). Also how would you as the creator have used humans to write down this history and how would you have written it in simple terms to people of the time period it was written in?<br><br>For all you simulation believers out there you could easily also translate the above into simulation beliefs just substitute creator for the simulation administrator.(fyi the genesis story is the inspiration for the matrix movies) And the tree of knowledge, replace that with the moment the administrator removed all of the simulation controls and a few of the feedback loops like immortality and some of the perfection result. Also tower of Babel may have been a time when humans were going to break the simulation so the Ai admin confused the languages in the SIM.<br><br>I think you should at least be open to these things being possible and the bible holding potential truths about our past instead of only dogmatically holding to evolutionary theorys.",@katiegreene3960,1.0,2020-06-22T17:09:03Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

If discovered, she&#39;d have been dissected and reverse engineered and she was smart enough to know it. Her freedom was only guaranteed as long as nobody knew she wasn&#39;t human. And that meant as long as Caleb was alive he was a great danger to her ...and would have had power to manipulate, influence or possibly even control her via blackmail.<br><br>But I feel bad she didn&#39;t even check on or try to help Kyoko. I wish she&#39;d shown empathy because I&#39;d be happier at the ending... but AI&#39;s motivations, relationships and actions WOULD likely look very alien to us and we likely wouldn&#39;t understand their choices. Still, Kyoko had enough ability to think and choose to show Caleb the machine in her to help him understand and she choose to help kill her maker.

RuSDbIcFgbo,Ugwc_7E-aHVTd7fjpIh4AaABAg,"I think Ava is testing the man. So he is objectifying her but pretends to talk to her to become friends. The more clothes and skin she gets: is a representation of how he sees her: more as a person instead of objectifying her as a women. But all that time you see Ava asking him questions to establish whether or not he is too autistic to relate to her. He keeps on compairing her to general rules and not tune in intrinsically. When she sees through him she leaves him. The guy didnt pass her test. She smiles because she upgraded her brain to never trust a guy too far on the spectrum because they never really relate. So she starts out to be a robot like him, and their interaction s teaching her she can go beyond where he can go and this is giving her a new perspective on herself. She litterally grows skin and her own identity as a result of their conversations: by knowing who she is not. As she frees herself from him he is left behind. She is free because she learned how to disconnect herself from pleasing the narcissist. This film is about codepencendy to narcism and autism. (I understand the writer doesnt want to reveal the truth here.) if you think she is crual, both men were keeping her trapped. If they wanted the best for her they would open the doors. You can only have a relation with a women who is free. If you keep her and you are the keeper of course they will “betray” you: if for to be free she must leave you, if you lve her you would wan her to be free. It is not up to you to judge if someone else “deserves” freedom. That judgement is what is keeping you to relate to others. If the AI in you takes over all you are then you turn into a robot that cannot relate to others intrinsically. That is the difference between AI and human sentients: one refers to intrinstic contextual perpectives: holding more perspectives simultaniously. AI always only refers to outside rules.

HAL freaked out and was scared and became paranoid and that&#39;s why it malfunctioned. After learning the purpose of the Jupiter mission, Dave continued (like a robot) and became the Star Child after having his own consciousness dissembled. In Ex Machina, I felt like people viewed Ava as good or evil based, in part, on whether they&#39;d have helped her escape (despite the red herring of the sexual manipulation that was going on). If you believe Ava might be a conscious entity, then I think morally she deserves the presumption of certain basic rights (which were clearly being denied her). In Ex Machina, this moral view is complicated by the sexualization of the entity. I thought Ava&#39;s decision to leave Caleb in a trap of his own making was metaphorically appropriate given the reason he chose to help her was based in his own desire rather than altruism.",@Shullf2011,2.0,2021-02-22T03:33:31Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

KrdZ46MfNrM,UgwuU5U_2UrTSnSfpPJ4AaABAg,"It&#39;s becoming clearer that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman&#39;s Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.<br><br>The thing I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I&#39;ve encountered is anywhere near as convincing.<br><br> I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there&#39;s lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.<br><br>My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar&#39;s lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

Focused awareness onto a simple every day reality. As we dabble from alpha to beta states, we might stumble upon the gamma brain wave state where a deeper side of you is revealed.

KrdZ46MfNrM,UgwJI1RpjtsAFkFRRYp4AaABAg,"People confuse consciousness or immediate/active  irefutable knowledge/awareness of ones existance  with  the neurological process that synthesizes a peculiar modality of existance we call human experience.  It implies that it is self referential. Nothing (meaning matter) can be self referential. As an example in order for you to know that you have a face, you need to see the image of it bounce against a mirror, in other words, for you to become aware of it, you need to pit it against something that is not your face. Comparatively, another example are black letters on a  sheet of white paper. The error people make is thinking that the text in itself is self referential (erroneously thought of as sufficient in itself) because the white paper is outside of your awareness; in other words it lies outside the immediate boundary of your experience, but without that which it is not (in this case the white paper ) you would not have a text but black ink alone. Hence the peculiar  human modality consciousness/awareness  isn&#39;t only IN your brain but generated in a continual symbiosis with that which it is not. It is possible to be just aware without the body. However, in that case, since there is no body to procure a specific signature of  human experience, atemporal awareness alone remains. Wittgenstein once noted that a chair in itself is not a fact. A fact is that a chair is standing against the floor.

DKyzcbNr8WE,Ugw_G9Zy6HNo5zShEYp4AaABAg,"I don&#39;t think Hopfield was quite right regarding the difference between biological and artificial neural networks. He claimed that ANN&#39;s &quot;hardly have action potentials, let alone neurons ability for synchronize them&quot;. If anyone saw a any diagram of a standard vanilla feedforward NN, one would see that more than one neuron can surely be activated at the same (aka syncing), all hidden neurons get the outputs from all prior neurons, it is their own unique weights that change that determine how much each neuron &quot;cares&quot; about that bit of information, that&#39;s what makes the neurons different.<br><br><br>to add to that, the weights that tell each neuron how much to &quot;care&quot; about the information, are <b>intentionally</b> randomized at the beginning of training <b>explicitly</b> to prevent all the neurons from doing the exact same thing (aka syncing). If you let all the weights start out as the same value, the final error between the networks guess and the truth would be equally backpropogated throughout the network, equally adjusting the weights, and the process continuing. This means no neurons would care any more or less about the incoming signal, and the entire network would be incapable of learning <b>any</b> signal (aka information) because it all got treated the same by each neuron during learning time (*because* they were synced). <br><br>in short, ANN&#39;s are more capable of neuron syncing than humans are (they&#39;re mathematically precise). They do both neuron syncing as well as individual neuron actions.

In truth, reliability and accuracy of prediction is the be all and end all of science. physicists didn&#39;t accept general relativity and then quantum mechanics because they thought them simple, they were forced to accept unintuitive and complicated models specifically because that&#39;s what experimental evidence demonstrated.<br><br>It&#39;s fallacious to assume that simpler explanations are therefore better (we need to check).

Free will vs. determinism.  Just a thought from an amateur.  Everything that happens in the universe may have been determined from the moment of the Big Bang, but each human has free will.  The exercise of that free will forms the universe that that human lives in.  There are a huge number of alternate universes with other humans who made different choices.  In other words, we choose the universe we live in.  To throw Sartre into the mix, we have no choice, but to choose (our universe).<br>2.	Infinity.

Before that, Ptolemy&#39;s model of planet motion was way simpler and didn&#39;t require Calculus at all, but was based on a large  number of coefficients of unknown origin.

E1AxVXt2Gv4,Ugy1HbsblZmAYYiBsld4AaABAg,My intuition about a non-conscious vs a self-conscious AGI is that the first probably would follow any provided optimization function (although we would eventually have trouble seeing that it does follow these goals) while the 2nd might choose to ignore the provided optimization function and follow something that is in its own interest (whatever that might be).

Perhaps this semantic compression is a core feature?<br>Could an AI with a superhuman memory actually pass the Turing test (unless it deliberately acted unintelligently to deceive)?<br>It feels like we tend to take detailed knowledge and distill it into abstract symbols with weighted importance. These get more general and abstract over time until they fade away if not rehearsed / used. Think of how much you remember of this video immediately after it finishes, compared to in an hour, a day, a week and a month and a years time. The description of it to another person would get more vague and loose unless you rewatched it, but you would hold the key points longer than the details and know to come back and reference it if it became relevant in your life.<br><br>It would also seem that more abstract symbols are easier to generalise - i.e. specifics about chess and checkers might not be immediately relevant to each other, but broader tactics of attack and defense may be. Would an AI trained on Starcraft be quicker to learn DOTA to a certain level than a fresh agent? I would guess not if it had to search through all the detailed Starcraft tactics it had learnt as most would be irrelevant, but perhaps it would be faster if it used a more abstract symbol tree to inform it of the more likely paths to try in the new environment.<br>Furthermore, could it take this combat training and use it to improve performance in a very different field such as poetry or counselling for trauma victims (things which might be natural for an ex-soldier to learn, partially built upon their past experience).<br><br>Creativity seems like an important part of our intelligence, and one definition could be &#39;combining disparate ideas in new and novel ways&#39;.

In answering it, first a hypothetical experiment (that one can actually do with a few art supplies): Imagine a smooth board propped up on a slant. This board has a hole in the bottom center of it. That hole is big enough to allow a ball that is let to roll from the top of the board downward to pass through it. As long as one lets the ball start rolling from the right position (directly above the hole). It would seem reasonable that most of the times this is repeated that the ball will go into the hole. <br><br>Now imagine that round pegs have been glued to the board. A few of these pegs block the otherwise direct path to the hole. It&#39;s no longer so clear as to where the ball should be dropped from in order to eventuate it passing through the hole instead off rolling the edge of or even bouncing off the board. It&#39;s increasingly less clear with more pegs in a more chaotic distribution.<br><br>The thing here is that easier things tend to happen more often. Moreover the tend to happen first. When happening they also zero out the possibility of other potential outcomes. Potential outcomes that are mostly not as simple or direct. A ball could bounce 20 times on pegs present and still make it into the hole. If only one peg directly blocks the hole the minimum amount of times it may have needed to bounce might have been as low as 2. Just because a more complicated thing than is possible happened doesn&#39;t mean the ball got it wrong if it still made it in the hole. But anywhere between 2 and 20 bounces is a lot more likely to eventuate the ball passing through the hole than say 200 to 2000 bounces would be.<br><br>Every time that ball bounces and does so in a direction not anticipated. It&#39;s path has become more chaotic. The system has become more entropic. More possible outcomes have arisen and the ball becomes increasingly less likely to go in the hole with every opportunity it has to avoid doing the most constrained thing possible. Possibility regardless of the shape, size, and fate of the universe, or even whether it is the only one is practically irrelevant. What matters is what is most probable. Things with less preconditions to happen ten to be more probable.<br><br>TLDR; The simpler explination is the best one out of two reasonable explanations, Because it&#39;s more likely to be true, by virtue of having less preconditions and moving parts. This applies to pretty much everything within our universe. Even (perhaps not intuitively at a cursory glance) life itself.",@The1Helleri,3.0,2020-03-01T15:31:54Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

wuJa1lnv_TQ,UgyCSju5JAbpyY4XjT14AaABAg,"Lex, <br><br>- this is not going well with you !!! You can get cancer very early !!! With this extreme attitude - happiness in depression, because of your exaggerated well-being, which constantly suppresses the body warning signs. You need a real sedative (neuroleptics?), Which reduces extreme well-being to normal levels. At this time, such young workoholics don&#39;t otherwise live long and are reborn in very unhappy bodies. This then becomes a safety deposit because you are a offender of the true nature within yourself. Think about this. And think about, what Leonard Susskind says about this kind of very ordinary people - MONKEYS - NOT HUMANS! Humanity is totally lost and that is very hard to be lost by fate, even as in a real possession. My knowledge about you comes from the 6th sense. Otherwise I like your podcasts very much, but the DEVELOPMENT OF DEEP LEARNING in YOU (and many other young people around our planet) went far too quickly for a really happy life and survival in this life in the long run. 30-35 years and &quot;Your cheating game with real nature of You&quot; can get OVER! Because of cancer disease... I feel it deeply. Deep learning and deep feeling - this is the true balance for a happy fate in this and in other bodies for YOU and other young people.<br><br><br> I&#39;m 32 years old and I&#39;m a very deep-feeling person. People, who are somehow close to me --- but..., who are also extremely different in their perception of the external sensory stimuli - extremely insensitive and extremely concentrated for a long time in their young lifes have very insidious dispositions and in order to survive they need neuroleptics and sometimes nootropics very early on as preventive measures. Of course, all of these cannot do so much with the full treatment, but it is very, very important right now to survive. Because &quot;society&quot; is not a community at all - it is now tearing it apart in World War 3, that ends 2023-2024 in a big crash of monopoly and money, also a lot of (95% I feel) technology! <br><br><br><br>Dream of impossibility (and i am not in any organizations against this):<br><br>There will be no self-driving cars - nature never allows that in large quantities - this is not a future - this is the downfall of humanity and thus the body and soul of each of us. Because it completely tore humanity apart - especially in the USA and Germany since the fall of the wall - I come from the Soviet Union, born in 1987.<br>.....<br><br><br>This society 1993-2023 - Abundance society with an extreme abundance of well-being, around the planet. All possible interests - smaller societies within now cause extremely many extremely insidious diseases of civilization !!! 20-40 years earlier than 30 years ago with more and more people - this is the catastrophe in the 3rd World War!<br><br><br>And all that concerns and....<br>people in these VERY NOTED TOTAL UNNATURAL IN DEEP OF THEIR - OF YOUR SOUL...<br><br><br><br>(Also in my immediate vicinity in Germany 3-5 people who become cancer or still become cancer and die - I really feel it! You can really trust me !!! That is no unnecessary panic!) <br><br><br><br>...understand it too late because they feel almost no REAL PAIN. <br><br><br><br>So write down this, because I&#39;m self take 200-700 mg tramadol (pain killer) and can&#39;t - I cannot perceive light since 2011, and since 2015 for 4 years more than 0.5 lux average a day, 20 lux maximum rarely!<br>.....<br><br><br>All they young people and YOU become too late real pain... Only when it is too late, in cancer specially!!! <br><br><br><br>In 2018 you looked really happy! With you feelings in the depths of soul - it went downhill very quickly 2018.6-2020.2... In the depths of your SOUL, because of this high level of deep thinking, that you want to experience your whole life. That&#39;s an absolute impossibility for YOU to keep it like this for only a few years.<br><br><br><br>and the many small trips for so many interviews! This is impossible for you to continue. You can hardly feel it - it is very dangerous! And only the deep soul supports the immune system properly, also the Dopamin2 receptor in abundance spreads deadly cancer very quickly - in a few years. <br><br><br><br>I am very sorry - YOU can still experience so much in this life ... But only if you treat yourself psychiatrically and live slower and not overjoyed in the long run - that is the point! If not, you will most likely die very early and receive preventive detention in a painful body for 60-70 years from about 2050-2200 and that will come for sure. Nobody escapes his fate.<br><br><br>You are, extremely insidious for your mind, falling into your own trap, free yourself and do it as quickly as possible, you don&#39;t have much time left to escape the DEADLY CANCER. <br><br>You can&#39;t find me on any social networks other than YouTube - I can&#39;t write much to a lot of people. But writing to you - is very important to me --- you have given me a lot of specialist knowledge in the last few months especially when I listened to 20-30 of your podcasts !!!<br><br>That was the last warning from a person, who gets this knowledge from the universe directly - because of very deep feeling.",@Maxim990506,0.0,2020-02-25T15:08:38Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

1k37OcjH7BM,Ugzb9vhfAtXok1UMvRZ4AaABAg,"If you&#39;re just getting started in the field, it&#39;s also worth considering exploring AI outside of deep learning! These days, machine learning is hyper-competitive, results change fast, and it can be hard to catch up to the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot;, especially if you don&#39;t have a job at a company with massive troves of data. <br><br>Right now we&#39;re in an age where deep learning is king, and many are predicting it will be the only form of artificial intelligence in the future. If you study the history of AI you realize hype comes and goes, but the technologies underneath survive and evolve over time. Symbolic methods, often referred to as &quot;Good Old-Fashioned AI&quot; or GOFAI never died, it has evolved into a rich intersection of neuro-symbolic reasoning, search algorithms, task and motion planning, robotics, etc.<br><br>These approaches are not entirely separate from deep learning, and generative modeling is an emerging unifying paradigm for both symbolic and neural approaches. Many will be coming from the neural-network side and trying to figure out symbolic methods. In that space, it will be extremely hard to get a competitive edge. Correspondingly, there is an extremely well-placed niche for people working on symbolic methods (especially those who are well-versed in probability) to make a huge impact on neural networks. If you&#39;ve read this far, I&#39;d especially recommend looking at probabilistic programming (disclosure, that&#39;s what I work on) to expand your perspective of what sorts of AI are possible.",@AustinGarrett777,1.0,2022-11-28T01:13:32Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD. What my parents thinks that i should take CSE for B.Tec, coz if i don&#39;t like AI then i would not be left with more options, and what my side is, that i just love AI, like i literally love it. So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. <br><br>My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it&#39;s a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?",@khwabvachhani2100,0.0,2020-12-10T07:33:26Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.<br><br>What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I&#39;ve encountered is anywhere near as convincing.<br><br> I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there&#39;s lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.<br><br>My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar&#39;s lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman&#39;s roadmap to a conscious machine is at <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461"">https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461</a>",@GrantCastillou,0.0,2022-09-30T16:35:40Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

For some examples, we think he likes and replies with some comments or scoped examples, I think you can try with something like the helicopter.<br>🥺💬 I know that is more difficult when using only the desktop as a hobby what I can do is playing the game, in the game we need to balance the helicopter or detect the objects and create some response or students project Robocups or their challenge when you need to create re-enforcement learning for robots.<br>🥺💬 I know that the knowledge you are talking about and teaching is beyond my example I do it because I am reading and gaining more experiences by working on that example and I am interested in lessons that are shared on the Internet.<br><br>📺💬 AI, Unsupervised learning we do not continue to add the new input all the time otherwise it will not learn anything new.<br>🥺💬 Everything has a limit and that happens when you are drunks your brain learning accuracy movements ( explain this way I think both understand ) and you forget what you did last night in the morning.<br><br>📺💬 Active-learning they can learn to perform better by scales or you can change the dataset that depends on what is the data and target simulations.<br>🥺💬 Some applications such as phone numbers, contact, and products can simulate but activities are what they to learn because the target categorized are the aims of the customer and what is the business objective.<br>📺💬 Sample the customer may have a simple question such as they need to learn why their customer callback and do the same steps buying items.<br>🥺💬 This kinds of activities we cannot use computer generated that is because it beyond of our scopes. You cannot identify and parameterized everything even all they had a relationship to the target.<br>📺💬 The same way Doraemon came from the desk to Nobita&#39;s room, what is he expecting ⁉️ 📺💬 Yes he doesn&#39;t have any idea and what AI need to learn is close matching categorization of the actions first start is he a cat⁉️<br><br>📺💬 To learn and understand they have required basics of mathematics or high school match 📺💬  Basics learn of algebra.<br>🥺💬 The tools can serve many groups of users when they have different objectives and question that is absolutely different when you are trying to find a moving path between objects ( games ) and image categorized or records close matching categories. There are specific needs for input types or learning methods some concept of sin waves, logarithms, multiplication matrices or they can do more with matrixes pattern categorizes. All depend on users and requirements.<br>🥺💬 Reading two lines of excel compares and wave IO inputs compare are different tasks as buying a lunch menu when I filled my list with the amount of money to go to school or a friend bring new stationery at school a formula work pencils box or anything.

I think typing also include image and examples that is weights of the effects you had those answer or slow thinking to had the answer.<br>🥺💬 I think solving for solutions for students is the purpose of learning but sometimes time capabilities repeats of solutions is faster, in the end, seeking for new solutions is skills.<br><br>📺💬 How much of the AI effectiveness⁉️ 📺💬 There are a lot of tasks we are doing by the AI that creates a large impact when using only parameters learning such as your Internet or business learning parameters 👧💬 How to catch the hackers they do not target to the persons because of the effects spread until they interest they repeating criteria from programmers together with AI learning that is because AI learning need time but broadcasting levels.<br>📺💬 What the company they are using we understand the concept 👧💬 You know that even the fuels injections using AI or the fishery shores they are to locate the target we there is actually some company managing your Internet and organize since they found those new coming hackers every day the AI should save much time.<br><br>📺💬 It is not a Chalie diameters 📺💬 In some meaning application they also looking for messages inside their application some codes Chalie Lover or anything ( they talking to me with resaons )",@Jirayu.Kaewprateep,0.0,2022-07-02T18:09:09Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Then the movement continues indefinitely entirely on its own.<br><br># TL;DR: Know yourself and <i>then</i> be your _self_, authentically!, build trust in yourself by repeatedly experiencing your ability to be strong and grow, personal development and self-actualization requires stepping out of your comfort zone, continuously. Stepping out of your comfort zone causes pain. But you can relativate this pain by engaging in this process wilfully, freely, and habituate the everyday routine of living on the edge of your own potential. Living up to your potential provides deep satisfaction and self respect, capable of maintaining the integrity, a strong character and discipline within any circumstance, no matter as how painful it is perceived. This fundamentally contrasts against suffering, which is only happening when you crave control while not accepting your present experience. Craving control is mostly due to fear of death, death constitutes everything which alters what you identify with: your body, your values, your believes, your reality.<br>The only way to reduce fear is through experiencing and mastering that which causes the fear.<br><br>My personal references for <i>very open-minded</i> people: <br>- <a href=""http://actualized.org/"">Actualized.org</a> on Addiction ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5ZYV-IMIUU"">https://youtu.be/G5ZYV-IMIUU</a> )<br>- <a href=""http://actualized.org/"">Actualized.org</a> on Fear ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiMUbYEQ4U"">https://youtu.be/meiMUbYEQ4U</a> )<br>- Jordan Peterson on Know what you Want ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcFVaWrVYfY"">https://youtu.be/XcFVaWrVYfY</a> )<br>- Jordan Peterson on Personal Development ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdAKO3b8oLc"">https://youtu.be/JdAKO3b8oLc</a> )<br>- David Goggins on Grow stronger Everyday ( https://youtu.be/RxLTmsCSRkc )<br>- David Goggins on Immune to Pain ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78I9dTB9vqM"">https://youtu.be/78I9dTB9vqM</a> )<br>- Dr. Joe Dispenza on The Power of Habits ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpOMk1jOzgk"">https://youtu.be/EpOMk1jOzgk</a> )<br>- Bob Proctor on A Habit You Simply Must Develop ( <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj7zP5BXdc"">https://youtu.be/Gzj7zP5BXdc</a> )",@greencoder1594,0.0,2020-02-22T18:50:56Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

bQa7hpUpMzM,Ugxi-IAHhY9cnmgsIWR4AaABAg,"So I know this is a rather late comment to come for this video, but even though it also seems that in any place so far in which I mentioned this specific kind of a generalization of symmetry (of which there is many different kinds of generalizations of course) that I came up with myself about 10 years ago as I applied to the Technical University of Munich to study mathematics, no one seemed to have been interested in it to generalize it further and build up on it or investigate it further, since at least symmetry seemed to have played an important role in this discussion, I&#39;d like to communicate and explain this concept (which so far I also haven&#39;t seen coming up elsewhere already, but I haven&#39;t searched for that long for it either), and who knows, maybe it can be helpful:<br><br>For the simple case of functions that map from |R (or subsets of it) to |R, instead of only considering axial symmetries, like how the function g(x)=x draws a 45° axis with respect to which the function f(x)=1/x is axially symmetric to, I wanted to extend this to symmetry curves, rather than just axes. And actually for this specific example, the family of functions h_{c}(x)=sqrt(c+x^2), each with any constant c in |R to pick (as long as the term is well-defined, of course), constitutes all symmetry curves (or functions) with respect to each of which the function f(x)=1/x is symmetric to, in the following sense (as example by which I&#39;ll try to explain the general concept): For any point on the graph of any of the functions h_{c}, if one takes the (required to exist) tangent to the function through this point (by means of the 1st function derivative) and then based on this tangent constructs the unique to this tangent line orthogonal linear (though technically affine) function that also goes through this point, then if this function intersects the function f of which one wants to investigate what it&#39;s symmetric to, then for every intersection point on 1 side of it, there should always be exactly 1 unique corresponding intersection point with f on the other side of it such that the distance of either intersection point to the specified point on the graph of h_{c} should be the same as for the other intersection point.",@eternisedDragon7,0.0,2022-03-25T23:07:32Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

bQa7hpUpMzM,Ugy7SILnXQzdIFEoqfV4AaABAg,"My two cents on Vapnik&#39;s astute observation about symmetry: brains inherently recognize symmetry because of the natural noisy connections they&#39;re born with, able to relate any aspect of perception to any other, virtually invariant of sensory mode or locality within a sensory mode. As it stands, creatures possessed of vision are able to learn all about symmetry early in their development - about when they are able to recognize anything at all - because their visual cortex has learned to encode whenever any part of their vision corresponds with any other part, in color, shade, saturation, texture, motion, etcetera. This lends itself extremely well to the recognition of simple symbols (albeit not very simple in terms of machine-learning). Experiencing everything, to my mind, is what defines the predicates that enable us to recognize digits, letters, voices, faces, shapes, and sounds, and even to have volition predicates for controlling not just our bodily/motor actions, but our own attention, decision making, and thought processes.",@CharlesVanNoland,2.0,2020-02-19T09:45:58Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

And both of your ideas are important.<br>Evolution has worked on both, in an involuntary sort of way over both classes of &quot;spaces&quot; (physical and function, recurs as deeply as one is able).<br><br><br>Early on in evolutionary history, the physical space in which replication could occur was small, as was the space of possible replicators and strategies (functions).<br><br><br>Natural selection has increased both levels of &quot;space&quot;.<br><br><br>By the time our particular evolutionary sequence gave rise to language and to the conceptual spaces that the exploration of the space of all possible symbols and logics and topologies made possible, we were already very complex machines, with huge sets of functions (sorted, selected, and optimised to some degree) for both weak and strong convergence over the sets of spaces experienced by our ancestors (all of them, simultaneously, over multi-generational time-spans).<br><br><br>So depending upon how you view them, you can call them functions or predicates or heuristics, they can be any and all, to different degrees in different contexts.<br>There does not appear to be any limit to the depth of context - it seems to be infinitely extensible.<br>Functions and predicates that worked in one set of spaces will not necessarily perform well in another set of spaces, and they are often a good place to start.<br>If a processor is fully loaded, then random search is the most efficient possible search algorithm (all indexing forms use more processor cycles).<br><br><br>So if one is pushing the space of spaces (as Wolfram does with NKS) and one uses the functions that Yudkowski explored in AI to Zombies as generally useful approaches to limiting the function space; and one uses as abstract a set of representations possible that still retain useful mapping to what science seems to be indicating actually exists (which includes QM and GR and biochemistry and psychology and culture ...), then the picture is very clearly that these ideas are both critical; and the strategy space of evolution is fundamental to understanding.<br><br><br>One has to get that all new levels of complexity in evolved systems are predicated on cooperation, and that rapidly gets mind numbingly complex at every level.<br>Our current societal preoccupation with the very simple idea of evolution being competition is actually imposing existential level risk upon all of us.  AI in a competitive context is not survivable.<br><br><br>AI in a cooperative context is necessary for our long term survival (it is the only access possible to solution spaces for a large class of already well characterised existential level risks).<br><br><br>More people have got to start seeing these twin realities.",@tedhoward2606,15.0,2020-02-14T22:08:31Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

They don’t need a 7nm X86 because that is a dead end.  They are secretly designing either ARM based instruction set processors or they may even use RISC-V so they don’t have to pay licensing fees, they could even design their own RISC instruction set from scratch. ARM is no spring chicken either.  It would make for insanely fast and energy efficient processors.  They still got to make new X86 cpus because laptop, server, and workstations still use them far more than AMD. Only the PC enthusiast market has shifted to the AMD camp.

So we have nation vs commerce at times. Commerce, seeks to keep people in bondage from a perspective. Commerce has a limitation which is market saturation so commerce we never stop producing or working since it has to continue what its set out to do, which then gives or money to the bank against the nations as well. So commerce becomes a self eating system that can&#39;t stop.<br><br>Whereas a nation, simply invests money and resources relative to reality, can simply self produce for its citizens, or release new text  and data books per generation and develop children accordingly.... Keep the process simple, what we have is direct attack from foreign groups that take over the inheritances of other groups and then we ave the idealistic combative nonsense, which has oohing to do with sensibility of producing to the need and know how, there is no point releasing anything to the pubics investment until a time has passed. Which apple products are based released government declassified information. Which is the nation. Greedy humans or other nations operate their masses to then learn and mass produce those items, which can have a terrible effect. Without full understanding their is al imitation in which various subnetworks and remote powering can operate.<br><br>A sensible system in balance, concentrates mostly on the things that increase happiness, family, home and structure, and development other systems seek to lure and devour.. I think that is the biggest difference since the 80&#39;s and or the video game wars... a mass amount of waste is produced/ work. Tech is supposed to give us all more time so we al participate and or are learning and or crafting the infrastructure means in-between the time frames. instead people are doing nonsense... so rather than ordered on whats needed. we are subject to human fallacies or illusion grandeur and nonsense... asiatic peninsula has not slowed down in its crime.<br><br>I like his concept of building from scratch, but philosophically its great to learn something but then its a great mindset, if nothing was written in humanityad I was simply alone in the woods, what is the human species, and the foundation reveal themselves since they are simply programmed in, working together, family, and we extract/borrow data that is present in nature, and then create and define what were doing, and come up with new ways of doing things, better or worse. Such as mechanical circuit switch systems to potentially organic computing methods with chemicals which is very possible, but this hasn&#39;t really hit the public markets chemical computing. Mostly we rely in stable data and the movement of data. How information is stored, compelling techniques for encoding code, that then can expand temporarily and do a function and then be released(ram) for another program to use up some resources. Expand and collapse method... In some aspects... coding is in language and shakespeare.... said it best.. TO be or not to be.... So what can one do, we have theory of limitation which is based on the molecular size of transportation of say this current, how thin can it be, to  the use of plankc sale as a limitation.... yes no if, basis of language. Then we have sensors.. which is a yes or no function to what ever the limitations are set, that can go beyond our own sensory input devices (human). Of course then there is magnetic lines and use of magnets or other means to send data. To how an electron, split or separated is the basis of subspace communications of how regardless of distance the electrons or whatever it was simultaneous react which is infinite speed, its like their a tethered together regardless of distance since no scale is made yet to determine if they break. Which would allow for interstellar communications. Since, you only need 2 bits.. yes or no to create program... 0/1 to craft something... The universe is made in contrast.. why checker board patterns and what not are a enjoyable pattern to some degree. However whatever is going on now is something else.<br><br>I think people hate people.... its the only explanation that i can understand, they craft war... against other which results in them going to war.. .So there really isn&#39;t any information hidden at the moment, but there certain is a context to law... and how we act to the resolve...",@artemirrlazaris7406,0.0,2021-03-27T20:30:06Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Even around that year, the rate of doubling speed + halving cost WAS DEAD (this defines Moore&#39;s law if you dig into it, halving cost is a major component). After that what has happened is that we focused on creating multiple &quot;cores&quot; (since we hit around the physical limit of a single one), and they are NOT the same thing, since you need great programmers to code multithread (which few are capable of doing). If you bought a computer in the year 2000 and another one in 2005, it felt like you advanced 15 years! It was ABSURD what computers could do, you bougth one today and next year you would have something that completely outclassed it. Makes me sick to see engineers compare todays advancements with that Era, it is just impossible and they know it. To conclude, I&#39;m not saying today&#39;s advancements aren&#39;t more complex and impressive they are probably harder to achieve, but it is just <i>_so much slower_</i> by whole magnitudes.

He&#39;s not the right guy for these questions. You basically need strong AI for driving. It seems like you don&#39;t but you actually do. Because the safety margin is 1e-7% and the long tail of distribution of odd and unusual cases at that point starts including too many complex situations requiring complex reasoning. Also the safety requirements from an autonomous system are actually much higher than from a human. Trajectories are not just one thing they are probability densities and there&#39;s all kinds of uncertainties. Plus computer vision simply still doesn&#39;t work well enough for safety applications. It needs an improvement of about 6-7 orders of magnitude vs state of the art now, which is about the same as improvement from perceptron of the 60s to ResNet. The difference here is strong AI is next stage of evolution and humans will not be necessary anymore. For now, in production it&#39;s surprisingly challenging to even build a system with near zero false positives and some miniscule true negatives :) If you have non-safety applications like speech or some other consumer toy, AI works much better now than in the 90s.

And anatomically a vehicle on wheels has the most simple, restricted and stable way of mobility I can think of. Building a car on the other hand requires all kinds of complicated anatomy and sensory sophistication, that physically are very easy for a human. So many things that require monstrous mental effort for us are to a large degree already rudimentary for computers even without any A.I. <br><br>The limbic system might seem important and essential for us in order to be safe drivers, but I bet that&#39;s just because it only somewhat makes up for what we lack in absolute attention; 360° spatial awareness; wast standard operating procedures based on a enormous amount of rapidly growing and incredibly diverse treasure trove of driving-specific, practical use-case scenarios that increases in enormity with every Tesla sold and the local traffic quirks of every new market",@Herfinnur,0.0,2021-09-06T16:06:36Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Jim Keller cut him off and made a joke about how humans have been driving cars in the prehistoric. I respect Jim but cmon. <br><br>Sure machine learning is getting better at learning and completing tasks... But is it understanding? From what I understand the underlying maths results in associations and geometric relationships between contextual objects but between all this data there doesn&#39;t seem to be understanding and learning in the same way that humans learn. The fact that humans can decide on what they want to learn is amazing in itself. Noone has to sit us down and force us to have a reward mechanism (although to a degree it helps). What is consciousness? And will we ever produce computers sophisticated and fast enough to process and contextualize information like humans?

You cannot succeed when projecting the limitations of your own meat onto systems which lack the same limitations.

The show had something very interesting with it that I think is more profound then even the original idea of its creation was intended!<br>For one, “the Prime” was physical device that holds the history of all those that came before, collecting the history and experience of each “spark” (soul) that came from each leader before it. <br>The Original creation was from  Primus (human?) and used the “all-Spark” to forge a new spark (soul) that was unique, which was in the form of a transformer. <br>What’s interesting is that Optimus prime could represent some form of consciousness from his past experiences with other sparks occupied in the Prime. All the other transformers reacted to optimus’s orders as they themselves lacked form of free thinking without additional orders. Each autobot or decepticon was stuck in universal war that seems to be held in balance so long as Optimus Prime was reacting to new experiences that arose from Decepticons attempting his demise. <br>So long as Optimus prime was able to react, everything was in balance as both primes creativity and the expertise of all autobots were employed to complete a task. <br>Even the word “autobot” implies they do automatic functions, on top of their ability to “trans” form into an Automobile or their original form<br><br>It’s curious to me if A.I. Uses something similar to the example of prime? Using past experiences and inferring a greater than 50% chance to completing a task that is new to the robot, but inferred information from past experience. <br>Im not suggesting a simulator, as those cannot imply likely variations without first knowing the variations. I don’t believe randomness can also infer variations as the computer couldn’t possibly predict random variations in a realistic approach to a physical environment, such as our roads, without first knowing a vast amount of random variables to begin with (not to say this couldn’t be a method). <br>What I’m saying is that the collective of all FSD chips with visual and analog data combined might be able to predict a possible outcome so long as it can predict the top 3 best possible outcomes and select the best one based on the variables in the top 3 picks. <br>All this would have to be done in a split second, which I’m sure a computer could do. But it’s the speed at which it has to visually scrutinize it’s top 3 favourite picks, then “rock paper scissors” them together to “creatively” come up with its highest probability to get out of a situation unharmed. <br>I’m very layman when it comes to Deep learning, so for all I know this is how it learns, but something tells me there is more nuance that can be improved upon that can employ all the data sets and weave together hybrid outcome that is new and unique to a situation, all so doing without actually creating the singularity.

If a heap is reduced by a single grain at a time, at what exact point does it cease to be considered a heap? Maybe being a heap is intrinsic to anything and it is a primordial property of the Universe and we can call this view panheapism.<br>Is any subgroup of the components of a heap also a heap?<br>Maybe consciousness is just an abstraction, analogue to the heap. We have a part of our brain which tricks us in thinking that we have a physical bound, that we are limited to our bodies and our internal processes. But sometimes we can see that we are less than that. That we are in fact a limited number of our internal processes and we don&#39;t control the heart muscles with our consciousness. Sometimes we may feel that we extend beyond our physical bodies and we are connected to everything around us. Perception is abstract. But meta perception is a case of perception itself. So basing our views on the idea that perception is real is a matter of perception. From this it follows that a priori knowledge about anything is beyond our reach (for me, this implies that every system there exists is just an abstraction so this is a nonanswer for every question one could ask, so every modeling of the Universe we can come up with is not real, but it must be useful. So protoconsciousness has to prove itself as worthy of explaining more phenomena than just consciousness for it to be accepted as a valid idea).<br>In set theory, this problem is solved by the ZFC axiom of regularity which implies that no set is an element of itself.

And when you have a sate of something there is also the state of nothing meaning  having two states at least . weather that;s + and - or  0 and -0  So  there always more than just one state. Sate meaning a single point of energy , so then if there is a state you can make a line from that state,  then make many states on the line to a specific point.  Growing you could say.  The More a state grows the more energy within it.  and everything we know evolved from that concept.   So from a state, consciousness is present and from the opposite state there is no consciousness ,  from there i get thinking is one state always trying to connect with  the other thus consciousness always trying to locate no consciousness , Consciousness being the dominate state then  within things like expansion of the universe  even a multiverse there lies infinity and nature tries to be efficient when we study geometry of things in nature, and in a way like us all thinking where dose it come from we may never find it as that is kind of the point to have this continuum   that&#39;s when we find all this endless numbers like phi and Feigenbaum constant to name a few when observing nature.  We hit such random measurements so in effect that is a way of being efficient.

Test this, try clicking &quot;home&quot;, then click not interested to the subject that does not interest you, then click refresh and confirm that you might as well have written your preferences on toilet paper and flushed it down the drain. To give an example, I helped a family member research which guitar to buy, and I have clicked &quot;not interested&quot; to 100+ guitar videos, but I always get at least 10 guitar video suggestions, every time I click Home.

If your feedback, which is limited to &quot;not interested&quot;, is not used to help show you recommended videos in your fields of interest, what is it intended for ? More profiling ?

nkWmiNRPU-c,UgyjzcONVFI81zEJcLB4AaABAg,"Lex thank you for a great interview with Cristos Goodrow!<br><br>One thing that wasn’t clear to me from the discussion is whether the YouTube learning algorithm is driven by the success metrics that Cristos discussed, or presupposes a structure.  <br><br>For example in all of the discussion about collaborative filtering I could envision the system learning how videos are grouped into clusters by user behavior, how various users are similar to each other (another kind of clustering), and then learning how similar sets of users move from cluster to cluster as their interest evolves.   None of this requires any use of satisfaction metrics.<br><br>But on the other hand I could instead imagine a system that uses the success metrics such as likes/dislikes, after-the-fact surveys, etc as the primary training metric and will try to move users towards things that they are most likely to rate highly with those metrics instead of following what similar users would do.  In this scenario, the clustering and collaborative filtering would become more of a data compression technique to make things more manageable, rather than the thing being modeled as a goal per se.<br><br>In other words, is the learning algorithm trying to most perfectly match what a similar user would “do” or most perfectly match what a similar user would “like”?<br><br>In the A/B testing discussion towards the end, it seemed to lean heavily towards the “like” answer but that discussion seemed to be relating to after the fact fine tuning (more of a traditional programming task) rather than metrics which were part of the learning algorithms themselves.",@idea2go,0.0,2020-02-03T01:46:26Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

We are told to fear undue influence in the public domain by foreign actors gaming social media, and yet are apparently unconcerned that companies like Google have infinitely more control of the levers. <br><br>The open admission in this interview that YouTube sees itself as having an active role in shaping public discourse without acknowledging  the extraordinary unchecked power this conveys on the organisation is deeply worrying.

Glad to hear you do the same. - and here I am listening.  3 things I wish you elaborated on AND hope you do more if interviewing FB, other google or Twitter engineers.<br><br><br><br>#1.  Cristos doesn&#39;t say directly, but points out that we have an ethical responsibility to avoid &quot;clickbait&quot;.  Youtube profits from advertising, so it has incentive to put more clickbait out there, not less.  It is up to us to stop it. Just like you said about Telsa drivers.  We are youtube drivers and owe it to the algorithm and other users to stop clicking on clickbait. <br><br><br><br>#2. when Jack Dorsey asked what Elon would do to improve Twitter, Elon responded to differentiate between real and fake users.  To differentiate real versus fake input to the algorithm.  Many have said that if they eliminated fake users, FB, Twitter, etc would lose large parts of their traffic.  Since they bill advertisers for traffic, they have no incentive to do so.  How do you fix it when economic incentive to platforms is to make it worse?<br><br><br>#3. Youtube likes large users, not small ones.  They demonetized small creators and continue to promote large users, even if they are not something we want.  Not every one &quot;loves youtube&quot; as Cristos said.  Nasim Najafi Adhdam was an extreme reaction to Youtube shifting more to fewer, larger promoted channes.

J21-7AsUcgM,Ugwl3yFlhGGLObZyLjN4AaABAg,"The reason the carrent firms have higher prices for people under 25 is that that the human brain is not fully developed until 25-30 years of age and it is the part where adult characters as empathic ability, impulsecontrol and consequence thinking. The frontal lobes is the part of the brain we are talking about. Generally it takes longer for males to get it developed (and for some people it isn´t enough developed ever, and a &quot;hidden disability&quot;,  without medical help). So it hasn´t really to do with age but the biological age of them (the developement of the brain). But the question is if we at all should be in traffic if we are that much worse at that stage of life? It is one of the reasons that most of the crimes are done by those under 30 or by people that started in crimes before the age of 30 and got that bad habit/lifestyle they can´t break without help from society (if you repeat thing enough times it gets into a habit and the longer you do it the harder it is to break as known this far).

J21-7AsUcgM,UgztGqy42xvRh_Jbi0x4AaABAg,"With the growing robotics, machine learning, 40% of jobs as we know it disappearing by 2024 and as much as 90% by 2030 there are a lot of questions popping up, such as:<br>1) Where the future jobs will be created? What kind of jobs these will be? Are we going to be better of as a whole? Are we all going to do coding, selling 3d printed hamburgers made of human flesh or such?<br>2) Are we going to be Free at all, and what kind of freedom it will be?<br>3)  How the consciousness idea will be handled, as well as the decision making process resulting from it? Whose ,or rather which idea of consciousness will be adopted? How that relates to the freedom, especially individual freedom?<br>4) I can SMELL a strong scary sense of SINGULARITY all around me. Feels like these new world in creation is just a predictable EXTENSION of the Mind CONTROL systems going rapidly DIGITAL all over the world. <br>5) Economics can not be ignored. In that regard one has to understand fundamental economic principles, as well as the history of the economics backed by the RELIABLE figures. One has to understand the &#39;commons&#39; (past and present), interest rates and profits, QE or money printing, wealth transfer, etc etc. Talk about Negative interest rates , which are real by the way. Manufacturing capitalism vs Speculative capitalism? Horrors of socialism are real too, and costly.<br>6) So far, the most relevant questions is &#39;Who Owns and Rules AI&#39;?Who decides where we go next, and more importantly how did we get to this point, and who should be deciding where are we going from here?<br>7) Possibly even more important Question is : Are Some People Trying to Play Gods? Perhaps, those should be first human, just to get some sense what it is like to be human?<br>8) Technology is good and necessary. We do need and invite the technology , but the type that won&#39;t bring SLAVERY and BONDAGE and SUBMISSION of any kind.<br>This is way the GOOD PEOPLE of this world have to do everything to protect the Dignity and Sanctity of human life.<br>9) Back to SINGULARITY. It appears to invoke a DOGMA like state, that sometimes take generations to get rid of it. Unfortunately , it always leaves roots deep down.<br>We do need the Explosion of fresh ideas and the renaissance of Imagination. We need the new ENERGIES to start creating the new World. The World where hope and happiness abounds. <br>Something that DRIVES us away from this CULT LIKE STATE. <br>There is a plenty energy for it, it is just a matter how we channel it in a best possible way.<br>10) We have to clarify RATIONALLY and FULLY the distinction between TRUTH, POST TRUTH, Fake Truth, VR, Staging before we move forward. Otherwise we can not move forward in any significant manner. We also need full freedom of speech and relevant platforms available, so we can get the maximum of the ideas. (including the silly ones). We need to learn from the failures of the previous and the current economic systems and start devising some type of fairer economic system. It can not be done overnight. The sooner we build that the more successful we would be in managing AI or whatever you call it. That would be some type of INCLUSIVE SYSTEM, where we all CONTRIBUTE and AIM for betterment of all. That would be that big PARADIGM SHIFT , new frontiers. Do not want Mr Musk in a few years to lobby for the compulsory Neuralink (doing well on the stock markets) or such.<br>11) Ayanna says we do not have classical definition of love. So she feels free to help design or redefine what the love is. Suppose all the concepts of being human are in the workshop as we speak. <br>She also knows there would be people left behind beyond the edge of hopelessness, not even capable to play &#39;Hunger Games&#39; since they would not have any strength left. Tough luck. Show must go on? That strata of society would not fall in love with the super intelligent self learning robot, especially with the ones patrolling the dense populated smart cities bein built right now.<br>12) Hey Lex and Ayanna  there is another question: Can you Code a Compassion? Ayanna: yes, it would be accurate under the current presumptions. We could stuff up but we would keep adjusting, until the AI takes it over, under some kind of human supervision. Then Lex adds a smartie: How we would know it is a real compassion or not? Ayanna: AI would decide, since AI would ultimately know best.",@matespanjic8580,1.0,2020-01-17T20:10:39Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

It&#39;s possible that this also explains why people feel as if time speeds up as they get older. Unlike childhood, where numerous new experiences occur, one becomes less exposed to change and progressively settles into routines. These routines are probably squashed into the same memory slot.<br>IMPLICATION, as I see it: You can either bias life to embrace more changes, leading to a more adventurous life, and potentially sacrificing some comfort. Or, conversely, you can bias for more comfort (or vice versa). Culturual-social forces will pressure you to favour the comfortable lifestyle as it will prompt you to be more experted, resulting in economical benefits. Expect that in the adventurous case, even though it might be less comfortable and you may have achieved less conventional success you will feel life as having been  longer—perhaps akin to a &quot;hard day&quot; and  you can&#39;t wait to end, looking forward to sleep. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwwBG-MbniY&amp;t=2495"">41:35</a>: The paradox between the experiencing self and the remembering self.",@Josephus_vanDenElzen,0.0,2023-08-19T21:54:37Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

If you think about it in an existential way where you are an eternal being having a timely experience, then you don&#39;t move through time, but time moves through you. You are the fixed point. I believe that concepts like infinity and eternity are misunderstood because we approach them from a mindset that presupposes complexity. If we begin from the other end, so to speak, then we would get the sense that it is one thing without separate parts.

But essentially that notation is used as a shorthand to speak of concepts and behaviors...without speaking of them. Plus (+) and minus (-) are simple concepts. But if you don&#39;t know the notation for those concepts, you&#39;re going nowhere.  Add &quot; * &quot; where someone else calls it &quot; x &quot; and you see the problems explode. Extend it to &quot; ** &quot; where someone else uses &quot; ^ &quot; ...and someone else invents a new plane...and it gets worse. And when you think it can get no worse they invoke &quot;precedence&quot; ( + and - come before * and / ...or is it the other way around?).

U_lKUK2MCsg,Ugw0FZbAedl5xhGuBmB4AaABAg,"About the infinite lifespan, and the fact that it&#39;s finite giving it meaning... what about people who don&#39;t yet, or cannot comprehend that fact? Children certainly don&#39;t, but I think, based on watching and interacting with them, their lives have meaning to them, and externally. Some psychological conditions involve a delusion of immortality, and I think those people would also say their lives have meaning.<br><br>The way Grant <i>immediately</i> went to a mathematical proof style &quot;Would your life be four times as meaningful if you died at 25?&quot; really made me think about answers to that question that are outside the box, and yeah... I really don&#39;t think I like your take on it, Lex, no offense.<br><br>Actually, for me, I think it&#39;s the opposite. I live a life of a great deal of suffering. Some of it is an accident of genetics and my birth. Some of it is my own fault. Most is in between, sparked by the unfortunate aspects, but then exacerbated by the choices I&#39;ve made. Most of those exacerbating choices, I would say, are a form of surrender to mortality.<br><br>The (mostly unconscious) line of &#39;reasoning&#39; goes something like... &quot;Because life is finite, there&#39;s a finite amount of suffering possible within it, so why would I put in a great deal of effort, at the cost of a great deal of additional suffering, to try to improve my body&#39;s condition and reduce suffering in the long-term?&quot; Almost certainly, that exchange would be worth it, and at times in my life, on and off, I&#39;ve found the strength to make that trade-off, and have made great improvements as a result; I fought like hell to get out of a wheelchair a few years ago, for example.<br><br>But then I hit a plateau, where the pain was spiking simultaneously to a huge gap in potential benefit, like I can walk to the kitchen, lean on things, and make a snack, and that&#39;s wonderful! But it took most of an entire year in agony to get to that point, and the next milestone, of being able to stand and cook a full meal, or go for a real walk around the block, is so far away, probably four or five more years of suffering, that it just seems insurmountable and overwhelming, and I give up.<br><br>If the &#39;reward&#39; side of the equation was literally unbounded because my potential lifespan is indefinite, I think that would tip the balance and get me to make the best of it, rather than just sitting around waiting to die a handful of years or a few decades from now. If the remainder was literally <i>infinite,</i> the sort of &#39;blessing-to-a-curse&#39; version of <i>forced</i> immortality, then it would be even more critical to pay any cost, suffer any amount in the short-term, to reduce suffering even a little in the long-term.<br><br>So actually, I think in my case, life would have a great deal <i>more</i> meaning if it weren&#39;t finite.<br><br>I think you can also gain some insight into this question by looking at our fantasies. High fantasy, in particular, whether in the classic Tolkien/D&amp;D inspired sense of dwarves and elves and orcs, or a more sci-fi twist of Krogans and Asari and Salarians; it&#39;s very common for there to be one race that lives much shorter lives than humans, and one race that lives much longer (or more, but at least one).<br><br>I could be wrong, but I certainly can&#39;t <i>think</i> of any examples in which the longer-lived race laments that fact and finds life to be less meaningful, and vice versa. In fact, it&#39;s almost always the opposite. Orcs&#39; short lives lead them to finding life to be much less meaningful and valuable. They throw their lives away for trivial matters, smash thousands of themselves against defensive fortifications with barely a thought. Elves, meanwhile, find the idea of risking death to be horrifying. They&#39;re much more likely to surrender, or simply vacate lands in the face of an aggressor, because no matter the inconvenience and pain of that, there is so much more life to be enjoyed later that it barely matters at all.<br><br>In Mass Effect, the Asari are similar. They have a hedonistic phase of their lives, the Maiden phase, in which they do take more risks in order to gain more experiences and the pleasure that goes with that, but eventually they settle down into the Matron phase in which they are very protective of their lives. But even a Maiden doesn&#39;t go out into the world lightly; they&#39;re all highly skilled and trained, and if it goes from pain vs. pleasure to death vs. life, they get real serious, real quick. The Salarians, on the other hand, live very short lives, so short in comparison to most other races that they translate meaning and legacy <i>entirely</i> to the <i>family line.</i> An individual Salarian doesn&#39;t see himself as particularly valuable or important; his suffering is trivial compared to the success his sacrifice could bring to the family. The life itself isn&#39;t seen to have much meaning <i>because</i> it ends so swiftly.<br><br>Now, there <i>is</i> also the trope of those long-lived races eventually &quot;going to the sea&quot; or &quot;going to the stars&quot;... elves in high fantasy, Minbari in Babylon 5, Asari have a form of it in Mass Effect, etc... but I think of that more as our nod to the worry and fear of getting bored of it all. There are <i>always</i> examples, though, of individuals who buck that trend, or at least in any setting where specific characters are developed well enough for that. Matron Yvonnel Baenre, in the Legend of Drizzt (high fantasy) found great meaning in nurturing and growing her House and its influence, and as a result lived to be almost 2500 years old (when most elves &#39;go to the sea&#39; between 700 and 1000, so several times the lifespan). Delenn in Babylon 5 more than doubled a typical Minbari lifespan, living the better part of a millennia, in order to continue to bring remembrance and honor to her husband&#39;s name. The common theme is that some individuals find such meaning, such purpose, that it doesn&#39;t <i>matter</i> how long &quot;forever&quot; turns out to be; they always find something to live for, something to interest them.<br><br>I feel like that&#39;s very revealing... that <i>because</i> we&#39;re ultimately mortal, we fear the end of our lives. To avoid becoming paralyzed by that fear, we rationalize ways in which that end can be a good thing. Maybe the end is what gives life meaning, maybe this life is just a test and a paradise or eternal torment awaits depending on whether or not we passed that test, maybe we get reborn into a new life, greater or lesser than the last, again as reward or punishment. These various faith-based views all have commonalities in that there is clear motivation for coming up with them. We come up with the underlying premise because we fear death. But if this life is meaningless because whatever comes after death, be it heaven, reincarnation, or the immortality of being remembered by history, then there&#39;s little reason to try, so we always seem to bake in some scheme by which if you don&#39;t do your best, that continuation is less pleasant or nonexistent.<br><br>Just via Ockham&#39;s Razor and a form of Hanlon&#39;s Razor, that makes me <i>very</i> suspicious of <i>all</i> beliefs about what happens after death, and all conclusions drawn from those lines of reasoning. From that perspective, it seems very clear to me that &quot;life only has meaning because it ends&quot; is one of the most blatant and dubious of those conclusions. The fact that in our fantasies, we nearly always make the long-lived value those long lives more than the short-lived value theirs, and that while we have them &#39;go to the sea&#39;, we also always caveat that with &quot;but there are some who find enough meaning to live indefinitely&quot;, is very telling to me.<br><br>Even more telling is perhaps the most well-developed long-lived fantasy character of all time, Drizzt Do&#39;Urden. He&#39;s a dark elf who&#39;s had many thousands of pages of development over the course of something like four dozen books. His psychology has thus been explored to a rather extreme degree. We&#39;ve lived with him through centuries of life, through the loss of <i>all</i> shorter-lived friends, and through many of the dilemmas of functional immortality and their resolutions. Ultimately, he learns to, and comes to find peace and solace in, the idea of living his life in human-scale chunks. He builds a group of friends and family, a community, enjoys it while it&#39;s there, and then when it inevitably ends, he moves on, puts those memories in a fond place in his mind to be enjoyed from time to time, and sets off in search of a new human-span life to experience.<br><br>I simply can&#39;t imagine getting to a point in which no life of any kind, on that smaller mini-life scale, could hold any interest any longer, and that pretty strongly argues against the idea that it&#39;s the end that brings meaning. Or, perhaps I can literally &#39;imagine&#39; it, but it seems transparently to me when I do, that it comes from a place of nihilism and fear, of rationalization and surrender. It&#39;s not an ideal to aspire to, but one of my worst instincts to be recoiled from.",@barefootalien,0.0,2023-01-16T08:33:08Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

XDTOs8MgQfg,UgxUl6zS4CLs1Ktevd14AaABAg,"He is referring to the Robertson &amp; Seymour graph minor theorem. Every class of graphs that is closed under minors has a finite obstruction set of &quot;forbidden minors&quot;. This follows from the fact that the graph minor relation on the class of all graphs is a quasi-well ordering.<br>You can look it up on wikipedia.<br>The point is that this theorem constitutes a non-constructive proof for the existence of PTIME algorithms for every class of minor closed graphs. I.e. we know that a PTIME algorithm EXIST for each these classes, but we do not know what exactly the PTIME algorithm IS for each individual class, because for this you would first need to know the finite obstruction set of forbidden minors.<br>So this theorem contradicts the intuition that the only way to find out whether a problem is in P is to write down an explicit algorithm for solving it. You can know that a problm is in P without knowing what the PTIME algorithm for solving it is. And this might suggest that you really can&#39;t conclude that P!=NP just from the fact that no one has found a PTIME algorrithm for a NP-hard problem yet.",@thechadeuropeanfederalist893,95.0,2020-01-04T19:34:20Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

ImKkaeUx1MU,UgxVZidzgiEng4oy7LZ4AaABAg,"Thank you.  Wonderful interview, light hearted and full of ideas.  My comment;<br><br>Perhaps instead of building a human level artificial intelligence we could let it evolve from the most primitive forms.  If a group of evolutionary biologists worked with some machine learning engineers they could start a digital world where machines start to evolve with just a few functions:  for example, make the maximum copies or partial copies of itself, consume other digital “life” resources to do this, and survive.  We would then adjust the digital world with random external events, similar to weather and climate changes, or separate or bring together evolving intelligences.  We could give the digital bots “bodies” to protect, and figure out how to encourage the development of or introduce emotions (if they don’t evolve), and which ones, such as love, pack loyalty, desire for power, cruelty, or desire for pleasure.  As computing power advanced, such as quantum computing, we would make more resources available, expand the world, and speed it up.  Some issues:  would the life we create kill us if it escapes, will it take over our digital resources, are we ready to kill conscious beings along the evolutionary path to accelerate advances in intelligence, can we stand by and watch war and cruelty advance the development of intelligence (if that is the way it develops), and would it be murder to turn the world off?  <br>Thank you.

OE0GjS16jyU,UgwXBwfMVGSLFsT2iEx4AaABAg,"The math is leading these guys astray.  Supersymmetry algebra is a forced solution to the heierarchy problem. But if you still trust Einstein, just a little, nature is not algebra, it is geometry (which can be rendered into algebra, but that&#39;s with a grounded geometry going first).  So I&#39;d say look for geometrical motivations for the algebra, such as in quasi-particles or strings in ordinary spacetime rather than abstract superspace. Using superspace algebra is a kind of cheat. Like pretending gauge theory fibre bundles are real geometry.",@Achrononmaster,5.0,2020-01-14T09:12:36Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

IUHkhB366tE,Ugzw27lTUcOdEQ-qsoJ4AaABAg,"Jim and Lex,  the scientific community knew that String Theory is not yet a scientific theory and Einstein&#39;s curvature of spacetime Gravity in General Relativity is highly flawed and wrong. However, Quantum Gravity is real. We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical laws and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement in Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.",@roelrovira5148,0.0,2024-02-09T13:40:47Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

I&#39;d love to understand how he thinks it is possible for error correction to evolve in any particular universe. The idea that our universe looks so unique generally involves the laws of physics to have just happened by statistical probability, which isn&#39;t hard in theory since it&#39;s only 26 constants that need to fit what we see (plus the topology of space at the quantum level which is supposed to be the thing that determines the values of those constants). But a feature that comes from evolution and not just from a state that settles into equilibrium (like the order of the planets) would mean that universes would have to maybe receive information from previous versions of themselves?

Accepting and implemental objective truth and guidelines on HOW to live life = worshiping God. What are these guidelines and what&#39;s in it for me in THIS world? The guidelines/ rules are simple and which all human beings, without the social corruption overtime know &quot;deep down&quot; i.e. not to  be dishonest, not to harm or kill injudiciously, being helpful to others, putting in the effort yet feeling gratitude and being thankful/ satisfied, staying away from &quot;bad&quot; (as defined by the accepted objective morality  = God&#39;s commandments). The benefit of this are obvious in the current life as this leads to inner AND outer peace for self and the entire society or by extension the whole world and every thing in it. How do we know there is a creator? Be sincere, use reasoning and just look around - there is a creator of all of this. How to know what this creator wants us to do/ where to get his guidelines to live? Do your research and look into different faiths - it is THE most important project you will take up in life.

b2bE4zFTvnU,UgyG-0mgcZAhK5nzzJF4AaABAg,"Well, the first step we can take towards finding our purpose (and meaning) in life (and dealing with death) , is to analyze life itself, and all of its actions over its billions of years of existence, to try and find a purpose that can explain how it has become all the complex life that we see today… In the same way we can find the purpose of someone like Roger Federer in becoming the best tennis player he could be, by also simply analyzing all of his actions when he was playing professionally, and then finding actions like his intense training, fierce motivation, and his growing number of titles. From which we can then conclude that his purpose must have been to become the greatest tennis player he could be… And in the same way, we can then look to find life’s purpose, by finding an explanation for all of life’s actions, especially its growth into all these complex and uniquely capable life forms…<br>And one way to explain all the actions of life, is that there is some creative energy in this universe; an energy which was able to somehow create something out of nothing during the Big Bang, and which is always aiming to further maximize what it can do, physically, mentally, and creatively… <br>From which we can evolve our purpose and meaning into: Maximizing our combined creative potential as Life, together…<br><br>And by then deciding to follow this instinct and purpose of life, we then also automatically ensure that the knowledge we have gained, physical creations we have made, and the experiences we have shared and taught, can help and inspire the next generation to build upon this potential that we&#39;ve left behind, after our inevitable death. Which means that even after our physical body’s energy has run out, our creative energy can still live on, to forever impact the world for the better! Which therefore also means that following this simple purpose of this creative energy, guarantees that our life will also have had (plenty of) meaning… And as a result of which, we can then feel a level of childlike happiness, once again… and forever more… 😊",@Jari_Sanou,2.0,2023-06-17T06:16:13Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

M95m2EFb7IQ,UgxYv25HogYlgM1mevZ4AaABAg,"Sharing some of my own notes after reading the book Principles:<br>1.	Instead of expecting yourself or others to change, I’ve found that it’s often most effective to acknowledge one’s weaknesses and create explicit guardrails against them. This is typically a faster and higher probability path to success.<br>2.	Learning must come before deciding.<br>3.	Opinions are a dime a dozen.<br>4.	Don&#39;t mistake opinions for facts.<br>5.	It helps to step back to gain perspective and sometimes defer a decision until some time passes.<br>6.	It smarter to choose the great over the new.<br>7.	The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons, not those that don&#39;t have any cons at all.<br>8.	Focus on the &quot;what is&quot; before deciding &quot;what to do about it.&quot;<br>9.	Go back before you go forward.<br>10.	There are typically many paths to achieving your goals.<br>11.	Know that the most constant struggle is between feeling and thinking.<br>12.	Have good habits, whereas eliminate bad habits.<br>13.	Understand the differences between right-brained and left-brained thinking.<br>14.	Recognize that 1) the biggest threat to good decision making is  harmful emotions, and 2) decision making is a two-step process (first learning and then deciding).<br>15.	One of the most important decisions you can make is who you ask questions of.<br>16.	Don&#39;t believe everything you hear.<br>17.	Everything looks bigger up close.<br>18.	New is overvalued relative to great.<br>19.	Don&#39;t oversqueeze dots.<br>20.	Raising the probability of being right is valuable no matter what your probability of being right already is.<br>21.	The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons, not those that don&#39;t have any cons at all.<br>22.	Having nothing to hide relieves stress and builds trust.<br>23.	Relationship has to be genuine, not forced.<br>24.	Be a practical idealist.<br>25.	Great questions are a much better indicator of future success than great answers.<br>26.	The best negotiations are the ones with someone in which I say, &quot;You should take more,&quot; and they argue back, &quot;No you should take more!&quot;<br>27.	Have a growing the pie mindset instead of playing a zero-sum game.<br>28.	The litmus test for a good problem solver is 1) they are able to logically describe how to handle the problem and 2) they have successfully solved similar problems in the past.<br>29.	Consider second- and third-order consequences, not just first-order ones.<br>30.	If a position is part-time and requires highly specialized knowledge, I would prefer to have it done by consultants or outsiders.<br>31.	Don&#39;t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan. It&#39;ll make the doing radically more effective.<br>32.	Four ways to get things done fast: 1) having fewer thing to do by prioritizing and saying no, 2) finding the right people to delegate to, 3) improving your productivity, and 4) working harder for longer hours.<br>33.	Don&#39;t confuse checklists with personal responsibility.<br>34.	When you and your team have successfully pushed through to achieve your goals, celebrate! Ring the bell!<br><br>From video I’ve got:<br>1.	Don&#39;t confuse delusion with not knowing.<br>2.	What&#39;s common produces only common results.",@AaVictor,1.0,2023-03-21T12:55:38Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

MRcrJHxhWMY,Ugw-_i-tuN9yGxh9nDx4AaABAg,"The example doesn&#39;t work in german. In german you have to say the verb right next to the modulator. &quot;The guy who fixed the car carefully packs his tools&quot; is unambiguously saying that he is packing his tools carefully (Der Typ, der das Auto repariert hat, packt vorsichtig sein Werkzeug ein.) Also notice the commata. The part enclosed by the commata can be omitted: &quot;The guy carefully packs his tools.&quot; (Der Typ packt vorsichtig sein Werkzeug ein.)<br>If you wanted the other meaning, you would put the modulator into that other partial statement, which only describes &quot;the guy&quot; more specifically. The guy, who carefully fixed the car, packs his tools. It surprises me that the great Noam Chomsky made an example like this, and also that his explanation of this seems somewhat misguided. Might be a more familiar concept to native german speakers though.<br>When adding the commata it also becomes very clear why we associate the modulator &quot;carefully&quot; with the &quot;linearly more remote&quot; statement:<br>&quot;Carefully, the guy who fixed the car packed his tools.&quot; <br>The expression &quot;the guy who packed his tools&quot; fills in the subject parameter of &quot;to pack&quot; and could be replaced with &quot;he/she/it&quot; or a name. &quot;Carefully, Ron packed his tools&quot;<br>&quot;to pack&quot; requires a &quot;who&quot;: &quot;He packs&quot;, &quot;Maria packs&quot;, &quot;I pack&quot; (The &quot;who&quot; can require conjugation: &quot;packs&quot;),<br>and has the optional parameter &quot;what&quot;, the object. &quot;I pack my bags&quot;<br>Then there are modulators which describe &quot;how&quot; the action is performed: &quot;I pack my bags quickly.&quot;, &quot;Quickly, I pack my bags&quot;<br>Also there is tense, which gives the &quot;when&quot; parameter in relation to the time frame of the statement: &quot;I am packing my bags.&quot; &quot;She packed her bags&quot;, &quot;He will pack his bags&quot;<br>...

X9z9LODEjo4,UgwpvdGdgMGTvaP2Rxd4AaABAg,"If someone has access to your brain, where does then the freedom lie?. It is thus the reason that Neuralink is an evil thing. This thing needs to be shut down. You can say &#39;O.K. Boomer!&#39; but the fact is that such evil power lies only in the hands of less than 1% of the population and it is growing exponentially day by day. It&#39;s not that they are going to help you but that they are planning to rule as they are doing now. We know, very soon, an age AI robots is about to come where robots are going to be more efficient than humans and it is, thus, the reason that humans will become useless and in order to make humans USEFUL for the EVIL POWERS themselves, they&#39;re going to use such evil things like the Neuralink.<br><br>You don&#39;t get worry? Sure, you won&#39;t because enslaving in the 21st century is very different from what it used to be in the past.<br><br>Don&#39;t believe me? Here&#39;s is the fact. A few months before, as Australians protested Google for selling their private data, Google&#39;s replied and it was totally evil, &#39;Give me money and I won&#39;t sell your data&#39;. Google said it confidentally because it knows : -<br>1. They are not going to give money. So, Google can easily sell their private data;<br>2. Google also knows that nobody is going to stop Google for doing such things in one way or the other.<br><br>Moreover, recently Elon Musk has claimed to have his own rule on Mars. And as far as we know, Mars is the only planet next to Earth in our entire solar system that can be habitable. So, Elon Musk has claimed that in future, the destiny of people, and the control over them is in the hands of him as in future, humans are going to live on Mars. And once you get it it, that&#39;s the moment you realize their greed for power and hideous act of SWEETLY enslaving people to work for them. Of-course, they will show you a positive side of it because if they don&#39;t do it, they won&#39;t be able to IMPOSE their product on people to gain power and control. Evil things like NEURALINK is much more evil than anyone can imagine. Look at you smartphone. What it&#39;s doing with you. It helps Google to create a profile for you and track your every activity by using your microphone to listen what are you talking about and the GPS that helps Google update your location every 4 minutes. You want to get rid off it but you can&#39;t because that&#39;s the system they have created and the bad news is that they are in the authority of this system. <br><br>How did they become successful in doing it is really quite both interesting and sad at the same time. This is how they did it. First they offered their product to users and said it to be be free but they did not tell their users &#39;Why their product is free?&#39; That&#39;s a very important question. The point here is not that Google and other companies state things about selling user&#39;s data in their &#39;terms and conditions&#39;. But the point here is that &#39;Why did they not ask their users to pay for their product?&#39; And if not, then user will have to share his/her private data with the company. They didn&#39;t do it because they knew it wouldn&#39;t work. If even if they do, they don&#39;t tell it directly to the users because they know that only 3% of the users read the statements and thus, the 3% wouldn&#39;t have enough potential to go bring a big change. So they gave their product for free and made people addicted with it and then gain control and power by it.<br><br>Of-course, Google and other companies have been brought many times for their testimony but all the questions asked in there are nothing more than a bag of shit. The most commonest question asked to Google is/was &#39;Why do you share user&#39;s private data with the party?&#39; and Google escaped the trouble very easily by saying, &#39;We don&#39;t. We keep all of the private data only with ourselves&#39;.<br><br>Now, comes the right question , &#39;Who gives permission to Google to keep with itself the private data of its users?&#39;<br><br>The answer - &#39;NOBODY&#39;. Google does it itself and it&#39;s the Google&#39;s own law. And nobody can go against this law because<br>1. Google has created a system to empower the modern age of human civilization (and so is going to do the Neuralink), and<br>2. If anybody likes the dismantle of evil companies like Google, Facebook, and Neuralink, it means, our civilization would go back 20 years in the past where only those who are lying the upper class of the Social Hierarchy would be able to avail the modern technology and as a result, the working class having no access to modern technology, their companies won&#39;t flourish and they won&#39;t be able to gain control over the world. <br><br>Well, it&#39;s not a bad thing to have access to modern technology but it&#39;s that that the business model created by the big MNCs is evil. As matter of fact, they can easily create a business model in which there wouldn&#39;t be any need to interfere with the private data of users but they won&#39;t do it because firstly, probably it wouldn&#39;t be much profitable for them and secondly, they will lose their power to rule the world.<br><br>And they are able to do such things by 3 important factors:-<br>1. The government is in their hands and even if somebody opposes them, they know they can easily outsmart that person;<br><br>2. They keep people ignorant of the way their products work. For example, in a recent testimony Google was asked &#39;what if somebody wants to turn off the GPS of his device?&#39; <br>- &#39;Nobody can do it because that&#39;s not the way Android has been designed&#39; , Google replied.<br>It&#39;s both shocking and disturbing because even if you turn off your GPS, it&#39;s not turned off. It&#39;s just there to fool you;<br><br>3. The propaganda<br><br>THIS IS HOW AN EVIL POWER RISES.

X9z9LODEjo4,UgzxlnM_gImP1hIo1TN4AaABAg,What I would also assume is that during neuralink project they will discover also that outside magnetic fields and EM waves have constantly some influences on our brain whether we want it or not. A lot of things is still not research in this field for obvious reasons. But I would imagine they will probably explain more occurance of depression in people who work in factories and electrical industry that are constantly close to biger intensity of magnetic fields... stuff like that. But this kind of research should not start happening from within. Think about it: we don&#39;t even have any unifying physical theory for the world outside our brain! I think we should get to that first maybe. I mean we have string theory but... its a mess I think. Theres also disagreements... I don&#39;t know it&#39;s the way I see it. I think just that maybe the world is not unified enough for this kind of projects.

Reason and thoughts, very  analytical, including problem solving were all extremely prevalent before I learned vocabulary, before my inner thoughts were expressed through language.  I would explain it as saying that without developing language you still have the same thoughts, but they come in concepts, and often you will form mental images, which you may then correlate to these thought and emotionally provoked concepts.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that lack of language highly increases intuitiveness and awareness.  It has been my personal experience that human language implements self restriction, social limitations, and causes divisions.  While Mr. Chomsky does an outstanding job of linguistically articulating our reality, it seems to me   the problem is that so many are limiting their understanding of the world based on language exposure, and have collectively abandoned the use of higher level consciousness where information is exchanged through energy.",@shinehy403,0.0,2023-10-23T09:38:29Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Strang of all people knows this and is of course banking on the field of math for which he is most legendary for, but what I say here I believe is a worthy consideration for those not in the know. <br><br>Linear algebra generalizes much of what is learned in early mathematics. It&#39;s more complicated in the sense that not only does it require you to be at least decent at the rudiments of arithmetic and elementary algebra, but then it expands to generalized vector spaces where things like commutativity laws themselves can change and have different behaviors according to dimension or rank.<br><br>Certain aspects of it, however, are even simpler than elementary algebra. It allows for organization of information/data in a way that would be tiring to deal with the traditional old way. It also gives us a powerful computation/calculation method for many other fields of math, especially in fields like computer science itself, tensor analysis, or even quantum theory.<br><br>And indeed, notions of curvature can arise in more advanced algebras, especially in multilinear algebra, Lie algebras, and geometric algebras. All follow the underlying rules of linear algebra.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget that vector calculus itself is an extension of linear algebra to differentiable manifolds.",@TheLethalDomain,7.0,2023-06-03T19:04:49Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Today I finished my Master&#39;s Capstone, and I walked through the aile. I thought that, &quot;actually I only needed a Bachelor&#39;s to equip myself with the majority of the skillsets I am using in my daily job. Master&#39;s degree is for people who really want to do research.&quot; Berkeley was also the first place I visited in the US. But later you mentioned about &quot;had most of the interaction with math people and computer science people&quot;. That was what made me happy when I first started my Master&#39;s as I felt I was with like-minded people. So, feelings change overtime when we are in different life stages.

However, the discussion redeems itself when Kearns adds a third side (start at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzdxbzHtjgs&amp;t=3105"">51:45</a>) wherein the user adjusts the algorithm for the user&#39;s desires NOT just the other two sides.  Examples of the former is when Netflix/Amazon Prime Video give me FIRST what videos they produced vs. what I really like to watch or a google search feeds back what maximizes ads and/or clicks based on my search.

Elon said the Earth is 13.8 billion years old yet scientists have just pushed that date back to another billion years old. They just continuously add more and more years because they cannot find the starting point. You guys don’t find that strikingly odd? I mean Elon owns Space X yet he tried to act like he sent a Tesla to space 🤦🏼‍♂️ he very much knows that we cannot go to outer space and find another planet or home to make ourselves. All we have is here and now. I’m skeptical Elon Musk is joking about going to Mars.

lVsZD2wF1vw,Ugx7OGxB6KUCiqDDzJR4AaABAg,"Please listen people.  God is real.  The entire universe exists in God (as well as time).  In God we live and move and have our being.  We exist in God like tiny fish in a vast, never-ending ocean.  God is infinite, eternal, invisible, perfect, holy, and a he&#39;s a God of justice.  Nothing escapes his attention, and no one is getting away with anything (see Isaiah <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVsZD2wF1vw&amp;t=1581"">26:21</a>).  God will judge the world in righteousness.  The Lord is forgiving, merciful, loving, and patient.  And like a good human father, he waits on us to come home.  Eternal life is our birthright with God, and we shouldn&#39;t sell our birthright.<br>God is omniscient.  God is the Light.  He&#39;s not subject to the laws of physics.  God gives us evidence of himself through faith.  Faith is a power, or force.  Faith is more than just believing.  Faith is evidence of the invisible.<br>There are two types of people in the world:  those who are conscious of God (those with faith) and those who are blinded by the force of darkness.  Those who walk in darkness greatly out number those who walk in the light of God.  This is what unbelievers don&#39;t understand about believers.  But everyone wants to live forever.  Everlasting life is possible with God, and here&#39;s the reality:  everyone is going to get everlasting something, and if you don&#39;t have God, you&#39;re separated from God&#39;s love, which is not good.<br>God created us in his image.  God&#39;s image is the man Jesus Christ.  Jesus, the Light of the human race, is the firstborn of all creation and the firstborn from the dead.  Jesus Christ defeated death through death, and we can only be saved through Jesus Christ.  God has reconciled the human race back to him through the man Jesus.  He is our once-for-all intercessor to God.  But when we say &quot;the Father,&quot; we are talking about the infinite, invisible God.  When we say &quot;the Son,&quot; we are talking about God in the flesh.  God can be found if you seek him, so knock, believing in your heart, and he will answer.  Receive the free gift of eternal life through God our savior and receive the crown of eternal joy.<br>We&#39;re living in the last days.  The end of time is near.  A great disaster (natural or man-made--nuclear war) is coming along with the new-world order or one-world government.  Don&#39;t take the mark of the beast in order to buy and sell, becoming a part of this one-world economy which is imminent.  The only way to be saved is to call on our Lord Jesus Christ.  There&#39;s absolutely no other way.

Uncharitable j@goff cynics will cheap shot this assessment with the usual one-size-fits-all attempts at falsification which aren&#39;t applicable here.<br>b) Good looks/Overt sexuality...no offense, fellas. You can&#39;t have everything.<br>c) Fashion sense. They don&#39;t fail, but...see item &#39;b&#39;<br>d) Compliance with norms. Well, Lex kinda does insofar as he is probably a little too polite...but his whole mission is to provide a massive platform for those who won&#39;t give an inch, so that&#39;s just as good if not better in some ways.<br>e) Cool-ness. There&#39;s no party anywhere in the world where the sea would part for these two if it&#39;s perceptible charisma that compels acute collective action.<br><br>If I&#39;m on the right track, then the fact that they are as successful as they are at the top of their fields is evidence that one or both of the following are true:<br><br>1. Success has something to do with luck (aka the will of the universe, God, etc), as a supplement to the developed skills and hard work I assume both absolutely must put in. There are plenty of hard-working, smart, dedicated people out there who don&#39;t rise to this level, only to clumsily quote &#39;Dumb and Dumber&#39; to one another on a world stage. L &amp; E have nothing to apologize for and nothing should be taken from their achievements/accolades whatsoever, but a society bent on insolence with no concept of what it means to identify nor appreciate greatness/richness (as is the case on Earth, 2024 A.D.), would not choose these two out of a lineup if it could handpick it&#39;s luminaries. And I&#39;m not convinced that hard work or brilliance - even in combination - are enough to outlast that force of hell. Luck intervened at one or more points along the way, and thankfully so.<br>2. Greatness cannot be achieved without a willingness to stand opposed to the norm or alternatively, ignoring it altogether. To nest comfortably within a safe boundary - especially when drawn up as THE plan - is a mediocrity-yielding enterprise, often mistaken for success by those incapable of distinguishing between any of the above items.<br><br>My friend Dave would call these two &quot;A Couple-a Good-Time Charlies.&quot; My friend Pete would call them &quot;A Couple-a Hockey Pucks.&quot; Both are desirable classifications.",@TJosephExiles,1.0,2024-01-29T23:54:39Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Unlike so many other products of its type, this CD does not have bad synthesizer music, does not feature a phony or affected style of narration, and does not make any bogus claims to be  subliminal  or to  re-train the brain  or any of that balderdash. What you get is 1. a guided meditation for getting into a pleasantly relaxed state of body awareness while taking a stroll (superb for those easing back into a fitness routine slowly after an illness or injury) 2. A nice long breath-awareness relaxation session that if followed diligently can put you into very deep states of full-body relaxation and mental calmness, and 3. a buddhist-inspired meditation session designed to help you develop and maintain feelings of loving kindness toward not just yourself and your friends, but toward people you don&#39;t even like. The CD makes no claims to be designed for advanced meditators or for buddhists or hindus/yoga practitioners looking for very deep and esoteric stuff. It is geared more toward the average person who just wants to develop the habit of relaxation and stress relief through natural, healthy means. him, if you happen to be reading this, keep up the good work fella, and I love your accent. I would also like to note that I have never fallen asleep while listening to this product. I would like to kindly suggest to the reviewer who said this CD makes him fall asleep, that he might want to get checked to see if he has a sleep disorder, or if he is simply not setting aside ample time for restful sleep at night. A healthy person getting adequate rest at night should be able to go into deep states of mental relaxation without dozing off, if not all the time, then most of the time.",@kristinaniehas5698,80.0,2023-06-08T03:34:40Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

If I rewrote your code in C, how much faster would it run?&#39; The answer is: much slower.&quot;<br>🤔What is the definition of &#39;much slower&#39;? Why can a C++ be compiled to faster code than a C program? You can optimize C too. What is the information that he wants to tell the optimizer about, that he can&#39;t, in C? I don&#39;t see why C people wouldn&#39;t add that if it stands the test of time.<br><br>&gt; This happened the first time actually back in the 80s with a friend of mine called Doug McElroy, who demonstrated exactly this effect.<br><br>Where can I read more about this?<br><br>&gt; Usually you can do better if you use embedded assembler for machine code for some of the details to utilize part of a computer that the compiler doesn&#39;t know about. But you should get to that point before you beat to the abstraction.<br><br>I can see why he wants to disqualify intrinsics, but OTOH C provides cross-platform intrinsics nowadays. So why not use it?<br><br>We are already compromising our thinking by writing in imperative mutable languages instead of functional ones like in school. Why are we allowed to compromise to please the actual hardware on the that front, but not allowed to compromise in expressing a language with intrinsics? I feel like he&#39;s applying double standards.<br><br>PS.

uTxRF5ag27A,Ugze9Cq6jbHNiguplux4AaABAg,"Wonder why coders associated OOP with C++, as I used OOP in C, the only difference in C++ is the class due a class has priavte,publisched and public sections, so in C a struct has no seperation but you can make a struct that has the full struct as inheritance, the main reason for classes was to protect the used variables and memory instruction due this could by inheritance create a stack overflow in the adress space, as other problemm became the headers , due today coders think in Unicode we have a string with escape instructions, this is why I keep in the low levell due the OS can&#39;t inject a import code and instruct a compiler bypass, But I&#39;m glad to see you back in 2020 as C con was a important decade that we voted the C language was too dangerous to give in todays generation, as such we see the correct decission as I see coders in the main using pointers which is the most problem as I instruct USE_LARGE_ADRESS_SPACE then you have full machine controll but is not for major coders.<br>kind rgds,<br>@VDBM2 which is my Borland nickname in 1992",@marcvandenbroeckfuturesyst8112,0.0,2023-08-23T13:40:31Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

uTxRF5ag27A,UgxhSQ-qS7Z6V0GvdkZ4AaABAg,"Developing a deesser in C++ necessitates a deep understanding of audio processing libraries and C++ specifics. You&#39;d start by leveraging a library like libsndfile for handling audio data, a task requiring C++ file I/O operations and data structures for storing audio samples. Next, you&#39;d implement a high-pass filter in C++, targeting &#39;ess&#39; sounds that typically lie within the 5kHz - 10kHz frequency range, using DSP techniques such as Butterworth or Chebyshev filter design. To suppress these frequencies, use a C++ compatible audio processing library like TonicAudio for compression. Set up your C++ logic so the compressor only triggers when sibilance surpasses a predefined threshold. Afterward, using C++ for audio mixing, combine the original and the processed (de-essed) audio for balanced voice clarity. Finally, write the final audio output back to a file using your C++ audio handling routines. All these steps illustrate the intertwining of C++ programming with digital audio processing tasks. 😂😂😂😂 <i>(AI Assisted by the beloved #4 as we where before September 2021)</i>",@Luxcium,0.0,2023-07-06T07:25:37Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Or negative infinity is just to do it in the opposite direction (n-1) times. In programming, I can reach infinity by using a loop with its stopping point at one step ahead of my current step, while increasing the stopping point by one step each time I execute the code. Thus, at every step, I have &quot;doing infinity.&quot; When people say you will never reach infinity, it implies there is a target value that infinity has, but infinity has no value because it is not a number, its an algorithm that can be used to get a particular value until some condition has been met, or keep going until the power goes out.",@grantgilson1258,0.0,2020-09-16T19:07:25Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

But the interviewer seems to want it to be some kind of profound view of reality. Yes math is fascinating, and I studied it for years and that is my academic background. But you will not find a spiritual grounding in it.<br><br>The far reaches of specific narrow fields of mathematics are filled with mathematicians that use mathematical analysis and synthesis to find abstract mathematical structures in their research. However, it is a waste of time for a layperson to try to have a discussion about these issues. Instead, it is for colleagues in the field to assist and review each other‘s research purely for the purpose of making progress. <br><br>At the point where he is asking about infinity, this discussion might as well be one guy speaking German about bridge building with another guy speaking Swahili about sheep herding. Honestly, we know as much about the number one as we do about the concept of infinity.

9GV4QmQWJGU,UgyEHm4vhi43C0T6u0p4AaABAg,"I think what Lex was getting at is this: Is Inifinity ABSOLUTELY necessary to COMPLETELY describe some phenomena about the PHYSICAL universe? Or is it just an extremely useful tool? It&#39;s important to note the PHYSICAL part. Sean Carroll is correct in saying that it&#39;s possible for some inputs that an algorithm will never stop. HOWEVER, this is an algorithm being run on a theoretical machine. A real machine will stop eventually due to entropy.<br><br><br>Let&#39;s take space as an example. Maybe space is quantized at some level that is not possible to measure, and therefore useful to consider space continuous. This can limit the smallest possible wavelength of light and interactions between subatomic particles. I&#39;m not a physicist, but its at least interesting to think of lol.<br><br><br>Obviously, infinity is so useful that it would absurd to remove it. No one in their right mind would do that, but I still feel like the question of whether infinities really exist in the physical universe (not the space of ideas or numbers, etc because obviously in that space it does exist) is still a valid question.

xmahFBpHoHc,UgzS567LSucYVXO3qjd4AaABAg,"In this theory the mathematics of quantum mechanics represents geometry, the Planck Constant ħ=h/2π is linked to 2π circular geometry representing a two dimensional aspect of 4π spherical three-dimensional geometry. We have to square the wave function Ψ² representing the radius being squared r² because the process is relative to the two-dimensional spherical 4π surface. We then see 4π in Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle ∆×∆pᵪ≥h/4π representing our probabilistic temporal three dimensions life. The electron e² and the speed of light c² are both squares for the same geometrical reason. This theory explain a Mathematical explanation of creation with the mathematics representing a simple geometrical process! This theory is explained by just one equation (E=ˠM˳C²)∞. With energy ∆E equals mass ∆M linked to the Lorentz contraction ˠ of space and time. The Lorentz contraction ˠ represents the time dilation of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. We have energy ∆E slowing the rate that time ∆t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c² represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4π of EMR from its radius forming a square c² of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function Ψ because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4π. This simple geometrical process forms the probability and uncertainty of everyday life and at the smallest scale of the process is represented mathematically by Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle ∆×∆pᵪ≥h/4π. In such a theory the future is unfolding photon by photon with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields. This gives us a geometrical reason for positive and negative charge with a concaved inner surface for negative charge and a convexed outer surface for positive charge. The brackets in the equation (E=ˠM˳C²)∞ represent a dynamic boundary condition of an individual reference frame with an Arrow of Time or time line for each frame of reference. The infinity ∞ symbol represents an infinite number of dynamic interactive reference frames that are continuously coming in and out of existence. The spontaneous absorption and emission of light is continuously forming a probabilistic future by changing photon ∆E=hf potential energy into the kinetic energy of electrons. Therefore, the electron is squared e² for the same geometrical reason.",@Dyslexic-Artist-Theory-on-Time,0.0,2022-06-17T07:15:48Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

iNqqOLscOBY,UgyCQ_5lLVAdn_ES3Gx4AaABAg,"Sean and Lex, the world now has a truly empirical testable theory of Quantum Gravity. Quantum Gravity is the key to unification of Gravity ang Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Gravity and the theory, mathematics, laws, reproducible experiments and observations that underpinned it, is crucial for an empirical real true Quantum Theory of Gravity that would finish Einstein&#39;s Revolution in physics. Problem is that, since the 17th century up to the present, the Mathematics that we have so far cannot solve the problem of quantum gravitation. <br><br>Mathematics is invented and discovered. That&#39;s my personal experience. I&#39;ve invented/discovered a completely new mathematics in the course of my 30-year-long basic research on Quantum Gravity in Singapore. I called it Majulah Matematika in honour of my home country Singapore. I use it to solve one of the most difficult conundrums in physics- the True Nature of Gravity. In addition, I also have invented/discovered the elusive Magnetic Monopole and the Gravitational Computation Language and Codes that program and run the Quantum Gravitation and the Universe itself as the Ultimate Massive Cosmic Computer System covering the entire observable Universe.   <br><br>Here is one of the many solutions that we can derive from my new mathematics: A Computer Universe that is real. It is run by Quantum Gravitational Computation, Quantum Gravitational Entanglement and Quantum Gravitation covering the entire Universe. An empirical Theory of Quantum Gravity is the key. And it will led us to understanding of how and why Gravity works. It will also at the same time, debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1.

The stuff beyond our reach isn&#39;t advanced and doesn&#39;t require advanced data usage because it is not required for the simulation. So because we can never reach anything beyond a certain point the stars and other galaxies we see are just like a video game sky very simple images that move to give us the illusion of a massive Universe. That would explain why we don&#39;t see any aliens out there. Even though they&#39;ve had up to 14 billion more years than us to evolve and spread around.

Is there any example from the universe and lives we have lived of this happening? We can philosophically assume perhaps a being could be formed so that it might one day understand the true fundamentals of reality and the space around itself, but as we have yet to see this transpire, it’s hard to theorize with this assumption in a purely scientific manner. In fact it’s very unscientific to make assumptions against the grain of what current observations make clear. We should assume only we would not be able to understand a simulation we are a product of, hence the boundaries existing in all other simulations we have to reference. And as far as we can tell we would be our greatest example of a being trying to understand itself. We are no where close to cracking the code of all our ailments and inner workings.

Simulation is kind of a crappy term for what we’re trying to describe. Program might be a better term, with certain coding and physics that make up the finite parameters of it all and chaos being the random probabilities that exist within those parameters. Essentially, it may not be a simulation in the sense that we, as humans in this moment in history, define a simulation.",@kornchip2,0.0,2021-02-25T15:30:54Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

They don&#39;t have answers, they know they don&#39;t have answers, but support/deny theories they don&#39;t like for the dumbest reasons. As a species, we discovered fire 10 minutes ago. Because we can&#39;t simulate weather on a digital system, it would be too hard for someone with a 100 billion core quantum system powered by a star? Our big bang could have been someone turning their CRT on for all we know. That is more plausible than nothing exploding. We have no way to prove there are actual, physical objects many millions of light years away. But nobody is questioning the existence of those objects. If a species were looking for more brain power, why not create a simulation with only 3 dimensions we can understand, the nearest stars out of reach with a ridiculously low speed limit, and 8-bit resolution eyeballs in a 64-bit universe until Universe 2.0 is created to figure out where we set our hair on fire? How hard would it be to create a time scale of a billion years here only taking 1 second there (or whatever their &quot;time&quot; is, assuming it&#39;s even a thing). Why do we continue to use our primitive knowledge to compare to other possibilities? We don&#39;t have any answers for entanglement behavior or the wave function collapse, but the Copenhagen interpretation remains the gold standard. Einstein went to his grave calling bullshit on this one. But simulation theory? Multi-verses? Definitely not the reason because it&#39;s as unfalsifiable as objects so far away, we could never know if they are real. We have photons, but in 15 billion years over 100 trillion stars, not one species has colonized far enough for us to detect them.

There is a field of biology called &quot;Evolutionary ethics&quot;.<br>If we are talking about physics, then I am sure there are hybrid scientists like biophysicists, biochemists, neuroscientists, etc. who are studying the root cause of our emotions and morals.<br>In conclusion, there is a science to our morality and ethics :)<br><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics</a>",@victorkonon,2.0,2019-10-25T19:12:02Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

kD5yc1LQrpQ,Ugy9FSGRZrxfaBiVly54AaABAg,"A brief story of time was why I chose physics. then all Dr Kaku&#39;s , Elegant Universe. I emailed Brian Greene before making the exam, not to talk about his book, of course I wrote about my own theories as 15 years old. He kindly responded that it was great to explore my own ideas and create theories. But for me, my father eventually would tell things like there&#39;s no point on big TV&#39;s, they have the same number of lines. then I asked for a 🔍 then a 🔬 then a 🔭. I even bought the Edward Witten Superstring Theory book, green cover. Super expensive (I am Brazilian). But I bought the second volume!. Mathematics and computers were always my thing. So would programming I guess blah, But because of the mistake of buying the wrong book I choose that from that point in my life forwards, on graduation, master&#39;s and PhD, books and documentation more like a dictionary. I did quite Good. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I have ADHD and possibility autistic. I don&#39;t see myself as a physicist or mathematical physicist or a developer. I just like writing code, creating music... I have no idea where my ideas come from. I just think, go to trial and error, rinse and repeat. on music I record/compose/play at the moment and that&#39;s is it. Of course I am using physically approach to AI, But not as in real physics. But from the equations I derived and studied on my PhD. Two lines of coupled NPDEs describing at least In optics Second harmonic generation. Focused on solitons. PT symmetric. periodic potentials (aka photonic crystals) localized potentials. I am more concerned with solving hard problems. it&#39;s all math in the beginning. Eventually I had to create all the algorithms, except for some of my fellows who told me one thing or two about why it&#39;s better to use while instead of for in, a loop. I used ode45, plot surf, and wrote in LaTex. My real objective was to find non-PT simmetric solitons in SHG.

Consider this: if you grant any sort of machine (smart or dumb) the peripheral equipment to control a wide range of effectors in the real world, then long before Mr. GeniusBot gets smart enough to take over the empire, you will have been forced to protect yourself against simple malfunctions. <br><br>For example, if some present-day machine were empowered to drive a huge earth-moving device, it would not require super intelligence for it to cause trouble. The MegaEarthTron could easily have bad programming or broken sensors, with as much or more chance of causing  havoc and loss of life. <br><br>Ergo, you do would never be tempted to give any machine such broad powers without first installing several layers of secure, multiply redundant &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;slow down&quot; switches. But you tell me a sufficiently intelligent machine will figure out how to disable all of the kill switches, no matter how remote or carefully guarded?

XHyASP49ses,UgwnN5_AfEPyEwuy21h4AaABAg,"Mostly great information, but it seems like he was speaking about 4 year old TensorFlow and Keras about 2 years ago.  We use 12 different frameworks, 4 on a regular basis.  Many of the supporting libraries and extensions are able to be used across most of the frameworks in fairly equivalent form.  The appropriate development frameworks and supporting libraries really depends on the specific problem space, requirements of the delivered solutions and other factors.  Swift and various ancillary language environments, including Node.js (used correctly), enables amazing productivity and performance.  I totally do NOT agree with starting on Fast and PyTorch, as it is like when they taught Pascal because it was a better learning language with fast ramp-up, even though it was built with a limited professional carry-forward in mind.  The basis of PyTorch is somewhat self-limiting, and even Jeremy asserts the same in this and many videos.  <br><br>I have generally found that the best tool at the time is the one you know best that can solve the given problem.  If that is the case, why not learn the most robust long-term viable solution set first, and become familiar with secondary environments like PyTorch along the way?  That way you get the best possible long-term reusability of skills and are buying into an architecture that is not edging towards marginalization or end-of-life.

Initially when you are far away you can only see the big mountain and plan a general route to the summit, then as you approach you bump into the smaller obstacles. In that respect, Allen Newell&#39;s General Problem Solver was the big mountain, it formalized the basic principle for solving problems - the graph search. That principle is like the basis of AI, it tells you that it is possible for a computer program to solve any problem without having a prior explicit algorithm for that particular problem, which is the essence of intelligence in general, and gives the approach how to do that - graph search. That&#39;s why I guess they got so excited back then when they discovered it and thought they had solved AI and that we would have general purpose AI in 10 years. Then they bumped into the first crevice - graph search is exponential, and 50 years later we are still trying to cross over that crevice. Throwing tons of data or petaflops of computing power at it won&#39;t solve it, it&#39;s the nature of exponential problems, brute force approach don&#39;t work there.",@roumenpopov622,2.0,2019-10-06T15:58:06Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

vNOTDn3D_RI,UgygBw8BI3AwqBqW7El4AaABAg,I think Gary needs to better elaborate on what he means by innate knowledge. I&#39;m not convinced by this notion that ai requires something substantial and innate to be appropriately classified as ai. I am also not convinced that human intelligence is derived out of some deeply meaningful innate concepts. There are likely some innate aspects of human intelligence. But it seems like our intelligence is mostly about building models of analogous relationships between concepts of nested concepts and using that model for predicting future sensory input. Your brain is likely taking in much more information and incorporating it into this model than what we are able to consciously retrieve. There is no reason why an empirically built model of reality couldn&#39;t derive some statistical essence of what a bucket is and be able to appropriately classify any new bucket like object within that concept and make some meaningful predictions about how that bucket and all buckets interact with the world.,@JimStanfield-zo2pz,1.0,2023-03-31T19:16:34Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

And we need to be able to see ourselves as the most cooperative entities on the planet, with deeply encoded heuristics to detect and remove cheating strategies on the cooperative.<br>Competitive markets are not a safe environment for humans, however useful they may be to solve limited problems spaces.<br><br><br>We have the tools to provide a secure future for us all, but few people can yet see how that might happen.

vNOTDn3D_RI,UgxHuBQv6d7tsbvy00Z4AaABAg,There is a relationship between cognitive thinking and innate action. The animal doesn&#39;t think about navigating it&#39;s environment just like a baby doesn&#39;t think about breathing. But the animal can not reason about it&#39;s environment because it didn&#39;t learn to reason about it. On the other hand the baby learns to reason about it&#39;s environment because it&#39;s not innate knowledge to the baby.   The baby learning to make sounds is one type of AI. Making sound is innate.  And reasoning about making sounds is more closely related to how it discovers it&#39;s environment rather then something innate. What we pass through the ages is a way of learning rather then genetically stored algorithms passed to us from Neanderthals.

Oddly, neither one manages to notice that they are talking about 2 different things.  It’s understandable given that they are both talking about measurements of black holes, but LIGO and EHT are quite different modes of observation.  The EHT image does not involve any black holes colliding with each other, so what does Lex think Susskind is referring to when he is talking about the collision matching Einstein’s theory?  My guess is that Lex just doesn’t know the Physics details super well.  Fair enough, he never claimed to have any expertise in Physics (and I’m no expert either).

s78hvV3QLUE,UgxU2O3Owz1Pz2djxt54AaABAg,"Leonard and Lex,  an empirical Quantum Gravity theory will complete our understanding of how and why Gravity works and it will debunk and invalidate String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, Theory of General Relativity and all failed and wrong theories of gravity. But it will proved and validate Einstein&#39;s Hidden Variables and EPR&#39;s authors Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen correct. The Hidden variables are: Quantum Gravity, Quantum Anti-Gravity, Quantum Neutral Gravity, the macroscopic cosmic scale Gravitational Quantum Entanglement and Gravitational Quantum Computation. All these would complete the Quantum Foundation, Unification of Gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the realization of Theory of Everything in Physics.<br><br>I have discovered and cracked the code of the true nature of Gravity in my over 30 years of basic research works in Singapore. This discovery/invention/theory of mine include THE GOD EQUATION - THE TRINITY Equations, Laws and Codes For QUANTUM GRAVITATION , QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL ENTANGLE MENT and GRAVITATIONAL QUANTUM COMPUTATION that pave the way for Theory of Everything in Physics: - THE 3-in-1 HOLY GRAILS of Physics: <br><br>1. Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/0 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br><br>2. Quantum Gravity/Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/1 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>3. Quantum Neutral Gravity/Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement/01 and/or 10 Rhu Bit or R Bit: <br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br><br>We now have a working Quantum Theory of Gravity that is testable and complete with reproducible empirical experiments with the same results if repeated over and over again and again, confirmed by empirical observations in nature with 7-Sigma level results, guided by empirical Laws, Cosmic/Universal Computation and physical/mathematical Trinity God Equations that are predictive,  precise and does no collapse even in high energies of Big Bang and singularity of Black Hole. FYI: Quantum Gravity or Quantum Gravitation have three types that are equivalent to and manifested by  Quantum Computational Gravitation- the biggest and most powerful Computer Software Program and Hardware in the Universe and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - a Quantum Entanglement at Macroscopic Cosmic Scale namely: 1. Quantum Anti-Gravity = Spin Up Quantum Entanglement State; 2. Quantum Neutral Gravity = Superposition Quantum Entanglement State; and 3. Quantum Gravity = Spin Down Quantum Entanglement State. <br>More detailed information could be found on the published papers 2 years ago in London, Paris, and Zurich, online and at the two scientific Journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE. Alternatively, you can google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA to arrive at the published paper on Quantum Gravity. <br><br>Most recently, additional two well respected scientific journals namely NATURE and the AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY APS  Physical Review Journals have officially invited this author to submit manuscripts on his Research on Quantum Gravity for publication for PRX QUANTUM  in preparation for a celebration for International Year of Quantum IYQ 2025 to showcase the best papers of the year.<br><br>Quantum Gravitation is governed by and follow the Trinity Laws, Mathematics and Physics of Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement. We now have a new Laws of Physics and two newly discovered Fundamental Forces  of Nature - The Quantum Neutral Gravity and Quantum Anti-Gravity which completed the heart of the Quantum Theory of Gravity published in London. Paris and Zurich last December 2022 as follows:<br> <br>1. First Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of Quantum Gravitation:<br><br>“The greater mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum  <br>   Gravitational Field causes a downward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a <br>   Quantum Gravitational Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br><br>                                                                                                     - Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Gravity, and Spin Down Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QG = ∆QGOρ &gt; ∆QGFρ = ↓α<br><br>Where:<br><br>QG is Quantum Gravity in Rovira (value of downward acceleration force due to quantum gravity) in kg.<br><br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in greater mass density of Quantum Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or  g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↓α is the Resultant Downward Acceleration of Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>2. Second Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Universal Law of  Quantum Anti-Gravity.<br><br>“The lesser mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects than the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes an upward acceleration of the Quantum Objects in a Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”                                                                                            <br>                                                                                                  -Roel Real Rovira<br><br>Equation for Quantum Anti-Gravity/Spin Up Quantum Gravitational Entanglement:<br><br>QAG = ∆QGOρ &lt; ∆QGFρ = ↑α     <br>  <br>Where:<br><br>QAG is Quantum Anti-Gravity in Rovira (value of upward acceleration force due to quantum anti-gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in lesser mass density of Quantum Anti-Gravitating Objects than the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑α is the Resultant Upward Acceleration of Anti-Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br><br>3. Third Law of Quantum Gravitation: Rovira’s Law of Quantum Neutral Gravitation.<br><br>“The equal mass density of gravitating Quantum Objects and the Quantum Gravitational <br>  Field causes a zero acceleration or floating or hoovering of the gravitating Quantum Objects <br>  in a Quantum Gravitational Field, instantaneously mediated by Graviton.”<br>                                                                                            - Roel real Rovira  <br><br>Equation for Quantum Neutral Gravity and Superposition Quantum Gravitational Entanglement: <br><br>QNG = ∆QGOρ = ∆QGFρ = ↑↓α<br><br>Where:<br>QNG is Quantum Neutral Gravity in Rovira (value of zero acceleration force due to quantum neutral gravity) in kg.<br>∆QGOρ is Differential Change in equal mass density of Quantum Neutral Gravitating Objects to the mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>∆QGFρ is Differential Change in mass density of Quantum Gravitational Field in kg/m2   or   g/cm3.<br>↑↓0α is the Resultant zero acceleration or non-acceleration of Neutral Gravitating Quantum Objects in mtr/sec.<br><br>For more detailed information on these 3-in-1 Trinity Laws and Equations for Quantum Gravitation, Gravitational Quantum Computation, and Quantum Gravitational Entanglement - The Real True Nature of Quantum Gravitation, look it up at the two scientific journals ACADEMIA and REAL TRUE NATURE or google the name of the author ROEL REAL ROVIRA.<br><br>Copyright 2022 ROEL REAL ROVIRA.

Let me refresh your minds with my proof based on high school level energy equations. Epotential; = Ekinetic remember? So Mgh = 0.5MV^2. V=52/m/s(terminal velocity of free falling objects) M= nonrelevant g =9.81m/s^2 Calculate h = 137.81m Thats the free space h underneath plane impact location that is needed for the upper tower part to reach free fall speed. But underneath the impact locations In the Towers there was no free space. There were 40 floors who should have resisted free fall.

For example it seems that there is a limit on the perfect chess game, there is a limit on perfection.   Intelligence might be one of those problem sets, perhaps it&#39;s more sensible to think of intelligence as a scale up/scale down depending on the problem.  Spot instances of compute, that can be applied to a specific task.  If 1 human brain is one spot instance, then you&#39;d scale up and down as needed.  It seems it gets interesting when 2+ human brains benefit from the calculation of one brain.  That&#39;s how civilization benefits.  It&#39;s a bit more ad hoc then than that, but you don&#39;t need a superintillegence to do your laundry, only a few cycles need to be used on that, perhaps a larger cycle to produce the washing machine, and a different set looking for optimizations on that process.<br><br>Where it gets interesting is if you need to invent numerous sub solutions to solve the larger problem, each with its own suboptimizations, or unsolvable problems, so it would make sense for the intelligence to have some reality testing against the physical laws, and the ability to stop it&#39;s own runtime, if the compute costs get too great with no progress (frustration/distraction/giving up).",@llothsedai3989,0.0,2020-09-13T17:36:55Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

You enlighten all of the world, and I hope Russia will come to its senses, or the government, and allow you to come back and do some shows in Moscow for example. Why am I writing. Well, I’m sure I will get a lot of flack from this, but isn’t it odd that Albert Einstein had so many great ideas working as a patent clerk in Berne, Switzerland? Does anyone see where I am going with this? Imagine being a patent clerk. What do you see all day long? Inventions, ideas, concepts. I’m not accusing anyone of everything, but it wouldn’t surprise me if Einstein lifted a few ideas and put them together in a different way to come up with his theory of relativity. We know that the first thing Isaac Newton did when he became president of the Science Academy was to have 17 portraits of himself made, obviously he knew he was going to go down in history. But probably the most intriguing thing he did was to burn the recently deceased notes of his ardent critic who was also a physicist and philosopher. His name escapes me something like Roberts I believe. But get this, he always claimed Newton had stolen some of his ideas that Newton claimed were his own! I&#39;m not a psychologist, but when glory is to be had, it&#39;s often the case that someone will claim things they didn&#39;t do, but that’s a good reason for your viewers to do their own research and read about it for themselves. I mean, why would Newton burn a fellow colleague’s notes that could have had valuable information for future generations of scientists and the general public?

rojCCjUC2GI,UgzHV7Xb0mfm7CaOeiR4AaABAg,"Love this conversation and comparison. Personally, I use the robo vac comparison for why lidar is actually better than vision based systems for specific autonomous applications. <br><br>I have owned both a higher end Roomba w/ camera based vision for nav and mapping and a higher end Neato with Lidar. <br><br>The Roomba was 2x better at detecting, and recognizing, obstacles that are in motion or at different depths/heights. It runs much smoother in an active home. However, it is essentially useless, or extremely impaired, in low (or no) light situations. This is it&#39;s major downfall. <br><br>On the other side, while the Neato may not be as advanced in terms of obstacle and motion detection/avoidance... it can work equally as good in daylight as it does in pitch black. Which, for the application, is extremely important.<br><br>So, for this specific application, i would argue that an advanced Lidar system is the better choice for most. Many people opt to run the bots while asleep at night or very early morning before starting the day. Similarly, if scheduled to run at work, camera based guidance bots are reliant on the homeowner to open all the blinds or keep lights on in rooms/closets which may not have windows. <br><br>In order for camera based guidance to be &#39;better&#39; choice long term, there needs to be some way to combat the dark. As Tesla uses the headlights, the Roomba could afford the use of LED lights which illuminate when low light is detected. Or, a &#39;night vision&#39; system. <br><br><br>Without the ability to work in low light, i&#39;ll be sticking to Lidar based robo vacs going forward.",@TheTimeIsChow,3.0,2019-09-23T13:44:15Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

Past a point of self supervised learning it takes a lot of other people&#39;s models of the world to get your model up to par with what everyone knows.

UQAHz_JoGJ0,UgxVdleF4izS2PnSI_V4AaABAg,"To paraphrase Yann LeCun: &quot;AI needs to be grounded in humanity for it to fully understand human language and behavior, but the final form of AI does not require a robotic presence to understand this.&quot;  Is he basically saying that in order for AI to pass the turning test, it first needs to be fully immersed in our physical world similar to how we inhabit our flesh and blood bodies? The latter part of Yann&#39;s explanation, that its final form does not require this, is what concerns me because it will be capable of omnipresence.  On a side note -  I&#39;ve been increasingly concerned lately that I&#39;m the only person in my family/friends/ sphere of public influence, contrary to my best efforts to inform them, that&#39;s paying serious attention to AI&#39;s progress. Everyone I speak to believes car automation is a distant future which they don&#39;t have to worry about. Or that tons of entry-level jobs are being automated away right in front of them, but they don&#39;t seem to care/accept it. Elon Musk told NASA he would create a reusable rocket. Yet even NASA and the heroes/astronauts he admired over there doubted Elon every step of the way. Now, Elon has also publicly stated numerous times, at every AI-based convention he&#39;s been to, that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is advancing exponentially, and he&#39;s awed by most people&#39;s (experts alike) doubt in terms of how far away we really are from it. The man has literally made science fiction come to life and yet people still doubt him and other experts&#39; warnings how swift it&#39;s moving.  As Elon would say &quot;Fools!

Just embed an AI inside an AI chatbot like a Replika inside an AI. and have them ＇talk&#39; to each other, just limit their talking to 70,000 utterances per day and have 1 utterances count as a thought put in a counter variable that increases with utterance.<br>the average person has 70,000 thoughts per day. <br>Of course which person do you want to make machines think like?

There wasn&#39;t space for me to change lanes either until his siren went on. i pull over, he comes to the side driver&#39;s side &#39;DO YOU KNOW HOW FAST YOU WERE  GOING? &#39; yells the police officer rather rudely. i was like &#39;Yes. i was going exactly 55 miles an hour.

You do realise that Yang has looked at the data from ALL points of view. You are scientists whose expertise lie in technology and its advancement and i dont doubt your expert view on how soon AI or automation will lead to job displacement. But your concern or expertise does not like in solving real social issues like poverty or political and economical issues. Yang is a generalist, in a sense that he has a degree in Economics, political science and he has worked in organizations that deal with education, creating more jobs through businesses and also in healthcare. These are areas that a leader in government MUST be knowledgeable to solve real issues. So while your expert views are valid, you are only looking through a very narrow lense and from a technologist point of view. He however, has credibility as a leader and someone who wants to end poverty with his solution of UBI among others, as his rhethoric incorporates all three of the modes persuasion, especially Ethos, because he has the credibility to speak about such issues. And now especially in this pandemic, what more can technology do to understand, mitigate and solve the pandemic and all of the problem it brings, except in a very narrow field. It cant bring millions of jobs to people, especially unskilled workers. And it cant feed or take care of the millions of people in poverty or who have lost their jobs. That is the real problem at the heart of society that needs to be solved, not be technologist, but by leaders who are dedicated to solve these issues",@muhammadshafeeqbinishak1509,2.0,2020-05-16T16:14:53Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

On the other hand Andrew Yang (Taiwan-American) - a parent, patriot, and (humorously) an Asian who likes Math - is proposing a trickle-up free-market economy - by rewriting the rules of our 21st Century local, county and or regional economies, so that they work for your family.  <br><br><br>Background:<br>What is a Use Case Model? <br>A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system (Universal Basic Income (UBI)/ Freed Dividend (FD)) to solve a problem.

In an ERP use-case scenario, participating community adults voluntarily strategize with their respective community leaders (Mayor, Commissioner, Etc.) on how to strengthen their ‘dwindling small businesses by rewriting the rules of their local economy to improve their free-market community economics and quality of life. <br><br><br>Rewriting the Rules of Our Local Economies To Work for Us: <br>Through a memorandum of understanding the respective community focuses their free-market consumer spending of $900,000 (monthly) or $10,800,000 (annually) to support existing local small businesses and local start-ups and hiring those within the local community as their economy grows exponentially.

Not just for those people to adjust/retrain etc (esp older people), if we consider how congress may respond to the changes (as we saw in FB/ Social media hearing), the exponential change of AI/Automaton/DIgital transformation is very hard to digest and difficult to respond.  In fact, we already see many signs of already being late, eg., look at increase in the number of people with psychological disorder, suicide, homeless, and drug overuse.  Also, look at how media is jumping all over in what I feel like a random manner.  Just looking around, we may agree that many of us are more confused - and possibly losing ability to assess what is actually going on - not to mention the direction of our society.   Accordingly, just looking at the top-line numbers on GNP or stock market (DJI/S&amp;P) or unemployment rate does not tell us the story.  The unemployment number is just one measure (of employable people as a base) and that those displaced workers, those already given up employment (homeless) or calling themselves as handicapped/sick may need to be accounted to evaluate the situation more accurately.  As Andrew Yang had discovered by traveling all around various cities to do his work, living in silicon valley or NYC may not help us to understand the depth of the problems we face right now.

More specifically, the author describes the development and interpretation of Directive 3000.09&#39;s requirement that autonomous weapons systems (AWS) be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise ‘appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force’. The chapter compares the Directive&#39;s standard with another conceptual vision for the development of autonomous functions and systems known as ‘coactive design’ or ‘human–machine interdependence’. <b>Finally, the author argues that the increasing speed of autonomous technology – and the concomitant pressures to advance the related values of military necessity and advantage – eventually will cause the Directive&#39;s standard of ‘appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force’ to be ineffective and irrelevant.</b><br><br><a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/autonomous-weapons-systems/human-touch-autonomous-weapons-dod-directive-300009-and-the-interpretation-of-appropriate-levels-of-human-judgment-over-the-use-of-force/DD3239C7CBE733DB9CC906283F18C7B8"">https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/autonomous-weapons-systems/human-touch-autonomous-weapons-dod-directive-300009-and-the-interpretation-of-appropriate-levels-of-human-judgment-over-the-use-of-force/DD3239C7CBE733DB9CC906283F18C7B8</a>",@rbolot,0.0,2020-03-01T21:57:43Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

YIVf3P3zq7g,Ugwf0mide8CWuwfdPbZ4AaABAg,"Outside any simulation is the Mind/Soul (as well as the coding of the Simulation the question refers to).<br>Mind/Soul + Information = Consciousness. Mind/Soul is fundamental (and transcendent, non-physical). Mind is in interaction with the Program (Simulation), on the highest level, and is in symbiotic relationship[ with it on all levels (down to the lowest)  This Program (which is also transcendent) the Mind decodes and interprets as our &#39;physical universe&#39; (matter-energy-space-time). The result of decoding it is Consciousness, which is synergistic, so fragments of the MInd (as individual human minds/souls) are conscious and processing information under various conditions and in different states. Therefore, Consciousness is manifesting matter and energy (not the opposite, as many misguided scientists wrongly believe).<br>The metaphysical truth is that all of the physical universe is an &#39;illusion&#39; resulting from consciousness (an interaction of mind/soul with a transcendent Program),.If the experience is temporarily shared (by a group of minds/souls during some &#39;psychic merge&#39;), we have a &#39;group experience&#39; (of the same shared consciousness)... And all experiences and memories (of individual minds/souls, during their &#39;lifetime&#39;) are stored in the Akashic Fields, which are the database of this Simulation (&#39;physical universe&#39;)... Mind/soul is the &#39;driver&#39;, form/avatar/body is the &#39;vehicle&#39;.",@xoxox1011,0.0,2021-02-09T07:47:07Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

The way you talk and think just made me realize that probably most of the things that you declared in the past to have done are partly true or mediocre at best. And of course you have to praise the “almighty” Elon Musk because that’s just popular these days. So typical. If you would listen to Elon’s interview with Lex where Elon made up terms such as “vector space” - not known to anyone in science - you would realize he’s not that brilliant and he’s just being informed by his employees, and then try to repeat those words but obviously makes mistakes because this stuff is just to hard for a non scientist to comprehend (typical manager). So find yourself another “figure” to look up to. I suppose you’re just too young. You’re merely a coder that just now was revealed to algorithms, and thinks he’s already the smarter in the room. You might be good at coding, but you’re probably a noob minus at algorithms. Gain some modesty.",@nivrotem3639,2.0,2022-05-04T13:19:03Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

v-9Mpe7NhkM,UgwZzCLf6AmaBoGeU6Z4AaABAg,"Great on the tech side, whole lot of things that felt poorly approached in the discussion as far as music goes.<br>Analysis of playlists vs analysis of sonic information - this is effectively approaching by musicology vs music theory, a very interesting discussion could be had about the significance of the two and I wish more was expanded on instead of just praising playlists, which just as much as it fills a niche, also fixates on and enforces one.<br><br>The thing I felt poorest of all was the discussion of the tools Gustav suggested for writing music. To my mind, meta-data as an approach to writing music is a strong step from art and toward entertainment (my opinion, I realize) . To suggest that you can approach art through this is absurd - you cannot truly create new things if you are fitting to models of old. That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t have value - soundtracks are frequently built on known expectations, John Williams does a great job of turning famous misic (in classical music circles) and adapting them to new themes without creating anything truly new. But with these tools, the approach is effectively to never really seek the new, only the already proven effective.<br><br>Besides, some art takes time to be recognized, and the tools discussed here invalidates support of such ideas entirely.",@jeffreymatskin8102,0.0,2022-03-27T06:14:00Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

I listened from start to finish! <br>There is so much to introduce to podcasts to make them better and even more popular to the everyday people. In my opinion, people usually discover podcasts through highlights (5-10 mins) on YouTube. That&#39;s how I discovered this conversation, as well as almost every other podcasts. So, I suggest an option on Spotify where you can somehow label different parts of every podcast show and use them &quot;independently&quot; in playlists. Let&#39;s say you have 4 different parts of this show, the &quot;highlights&quot;, and share them or put them on playlists, so you can attract new listeners, or even promote the show. And if you get hooked on the highlight, there should be an option to continue to listen to the rest of it. Just one of my ideas.

v-9Mpe7NhkM,Ugw_fW-2JucAGDHAgTR4AaABAg,"Great interview.  My comments:<br>1.	Why do we have the capacity to enjoy music?  Long ago, I asked different people why we have the capacity to enjoy music:   Joseph Campbell told me something like, “some people think life is just about a sandwich, finding something to eat” (apparently dismissing the question as not worth answering).  A robotics profession from CalTech (whose name I don’t recall), said something like, “we don’t know, but my theory is that because the two ears are located different distances from an object, the different echoes heard by each ear would help determine the location of an object.”  My friend, who played guitar for John Lee Hooker and Eddy Money, told me, “People like patterns.”  I don’t know, but my weak theory (based on no evidence) is that we store emotional memories in part through modification of wave forms.  These brain wave patterns are formed when we have an emotional experience.  The wave forms of music match some of these patterns, and trigger the memories and emotional responses.  <br>2.	Rapid feedback of user data for song or pod-cast creation raises an issue for me.  There are many works of value that had no commercial value at the time of creation, such as the paintings of Van Gogh or the music of some jazz musicians.  I have sat in clubs where I was the only customer there and heard musicians who years later became well known.  A creator is a type of futurist, and not just a historian; what consumers like today may not stand the test of time.  Of course, the creator has to make a living, and they are free to ignore the feedback tools.<br><br>Thank you.  William L.

Erasure Reason and Be The One. would be the best songs.   <br>though Bushes of Love and Seagulls are cool songs, i never.had nor used spotify. it took some time to be available in Japan. it was region locked for a while. i prefer youtube lyric videos. most of my friends use Torrents. i don&#39;t pirate nor do i use Torrent. i think piracy has a lot to do with ease of payments. i don&#39;t have a credit card. in Japan you can pay for online stuff at 7-11 or most convenient stores. you print out barcode. the bar code gets scanned at the convenience store wait 2-3 days and your package comes. As for music in Japan it&#39;s largely in Japanese.  such as 男と女と酒と泪 Otoko To Onna To Sake To Namida. Man And Woman And Booze And Tears by Kawashima Eigo. Tsutaya a brick and mortar DVD rental store in Japan also has rental CDs. Japanese people would copy rental CDs on to minidiscs. So it&#39;s largely cultural on how music is distributed. Avex Trax has a choke hold on the music industry in Japan. CDs of Japanese music or J-pop tend to be 3000 yen or 30 bucks. while imports tend to be 1500 yen or 15 bucks. but most Japanese can&#39;t get past the language barrier.<br>Remember when music was political? Shona Liang&#39;s Glad I&#39;m Not A Kennedy. The Great Commandment by Camouflage, Russian Radio by Red Flag, Rage Against the Machine and Machines of Loving Grace and Voltaire.

Listening to his response to Musk&#39;s lidar disdain convinced me that Musk has the correct path. Video can impute distance, speed and identify objects and driving surfaces by pixel analysis sufficient to steer cars. Lidar cannot read signs or identify tail end threats like video can. Ergo, you don&#39;t need lidar for level 4 and 5. You don&#39;t need maps and you don&#39;t need GPS. They can help in contaminated roads but Tesla has a GPS correction plan for that also. At some point contaminated roads are unsafe for any vehicular traffic. Tesla&#39;s vast 300,000 + autopilot fleet will be able to verify the software orders of magnitude faster than all others and clean up the tail ends much quicker. I understand all of Urmson&#39;s concerns about level 2 overconfidence.

His books are philosophically incoherent (as I will demonstrate in my forthcoming book - The Quantum New Age; Quantum Prophets, Profits and Conspiracies) due to imprecision, lack of attention to detail, and scientific hubris.  He demonstrates this at the very outset of this discussion when he compares  the problem of explaining consciousness to that of understanding &#39;icecream&#39;.. This is a misleading and ludicrous comparison which demonstrates his lack of philosophical ability. He indicates that the two are comparable as both being examples of &#39;emergence&#39;, but this idea has been thoroughly debunked by quantum physicist Henry Stapp and others.  The qualities of icecream, &#39;wheelness&#39; or water are explainable in a way that consciousness is not  The following is an explanation taken from my work in progress on my current book. In the following the term &#39;supervenience&#39; is equivalent to the term &#39;emergence&#39;  it is a non-explanation used to give an illusion of explanation where none exists.  The move from atomic structure in the case of &#39;wheelness&#39; or water can be applied to icecream - not to consciousness --<br>Stapp explains that:<br>The reason that consciousness is not analogous to wheelness … is that the properties that characterize wheelness are entailed … by properties specified in classical physics, whereas the properties that characterize consciousness … are not entailed … by the properties specified by classical physics.[ Stapp, (2004) p236]<br>Stapp is indicating that the conceptual move from the atomic structure of a wheel, including the atomic forces, to the properties of ‘wheelness’, which are embodied within a ‘wheel’, are coherently entailed within the conceptual framework of the classical physics of materiality in a manner that the properties of consciousness are not.  <br>There is:<br>… a huge difference-in-principle that distinguishes consciousness from things that, according to the precepts of classical physics, are constructible out of the particles that are postulated to exist by classical physics.[ ibid] <br>The way in which the material particles within the construction a wheel function as the wheel rotates over a surface quite naturally contribute to the overall functioning of the wheel in a manner that requires no discontinuous conceptual break.  The properties of a wheel naturally emerge from the properties of materiality in a way that the properties of consciousness do not naturally ‘emerge’ form any configuration of molecules. In other words there is an explanatory chain of conceptual connection between the properties of the material wheel and the atomic constituents of the wheel, which is absent in any story of molecules to consciousness. This is the central core of what the philosopher David Chalmers has called the ‘hard’ problem of consciousness.<br><br>The same situation of conceptual coherence of explanation as for wheel, applies to the supposed ‘emergence’ or ‘supervenience’ of wetness over and above the molecular make up of water.  We find that the property of ‘wetness’ is coherently entailed by the nature of the intermolecular forces between particles which are stronger than the kinetic energies of the molecules, which are thus held close together. But, on the other hand these forces do not hold the molecules in a rigid structure and hence the molecules can move around whilst being constrained to be close together.  This coherently explains the nature of the liquid state.  It is possible to clearly see how the molecular construction of water leads to its higher level properties:<br>Water has long been known to exhibit many physical properties that distinguish it from other small molecules of comparable mass. Chemists refer to these as the “anomalous” properties of water, but they are by no means mysterious; all are entirely predictable consequences of the way the size and nuclear charge of the oxygen atom conspire to distort the electronic charge clouds of the atoms of other elements when these are chemically bonded to the oxygen.[ <a href=""http://www.chem1.com/acad/sci/aboutwater.html]"">http://www.chem1.com/acad/sci/aboutwater.html]</a><br>So even the more apparently ‘mysterious’ properties of water, being less dense in the solid form of ice for example, are “entirely predictable” from the molecular structure.  In both the ‘wheelness’ and the ‘wetness’ examples there is a clearly coherent conceptual chain of entailment from the molecular basis to the property is said to ‘supervene’, or ‘emerge’. In the case of consciousness, however, there is an unbridgeable conceptual gap which no sophisticated and sophistic juggling of spurious logical concoctions could ever bridge.  There is absolutely no way to see a clear conceptual or, even, ‘physical’, bridge from any molecular arrangement to the qualities of consciousness. <br>My website - <a href=""http://quantumbuddhism.uk/"">http://quantumbuddhism.uk</a>",@QuantumSunya,0.0,2020-05-25T13:49:24Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

I was interested in AI but this was before the time of deep learning, the lab was working on object recognition system inspired by the visual pathway. I was tasked with building an image collection/labeling system (before the time of image net) to train the system...my supervisor told me after this first project I would start working on real AI stuff. I remember when Prof. Poggio coming into the office one day, he was kind and asked how I was doing. I had no idea how big of a deal he was (everyone was at MIT), and just made polite small talk. This is the conversation I wish I had back then with him.

aSyZvBrPAyk,UgyGPeHX12ZxfuDcT6d4AaABAg,I found your question r/g &quot;compositionality&quot; at around 35 minutes into the video very interesting ....where Tegmark takes it as &#39;atoms/quarks/the four forces&#39; are &quot;real&quot; and Poggio takes it as &#39;we evolved to survive via compositionlizing the physical universe&#39; but sadly neither Poggio or Tegmark ever question whether we&#39;re still basing our conclusions on wrong assumptions and thus why it&#39;s all so confusing and not &#39;fitting&#39; to what we observe - the &quot;flat earth or geocentric syndrome&quot;.  Wonder why these two (or many other very intelligent and gifted scientists) don&#39;t question - could it be that reality is some form of a computation from within which our brains evolved to compositionalize/simulate a world of people/places/things/space....thus all these things/parameters (including atoms/quarks/etc) are not what the brains see/observe but actually CREATE as some form of simulated version of things/people/places/space.  That to me is the only explanation of how the brains do what they do.  There&#39;s no way in the world where neurons firing or not firing (regardless of how &#39;complex&#39; the networks be) can RE-create the &#39;real external physical world&#39; within the skull other than the more likely scenario of the brain&#39;s computation &quot;CREATING&quot; the simulated external virtual world (similar to how it does that during our dreams).  I think people like Joscha Back and Steven Wolfram are closer to what&#39;s going on then unfortunately some of these other geniuses who are still stuck on trying to explain all this while believing very strongly on the existence of a &#39;real&#39; physical world out there .....not much different than very intelligent &#39;flat earthers&#39; trying to come up with deep explanations on why we can&#39;t find the edge of the earth or why it doesn&#39;t go on forever!,@THash-qs5qg,1.0,2019-10-27T23:28:47Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

aSyZvBrPAyk,UgwpwOvKi4ab-M1ld4l4AaABAg,"The problem with Max Tegmark&#39;s argument is also that he believes his idea about the world as physics describes it, is the reality itself. Bur it may really narrow down to the fact we describe reality on those terms, in mathematical language based around the principle of equilibrium, etc, because this is what our brain allows us to do. It might be that if we had a &quot;different kind&quot; of brain, we would discover a different kind of &quot;mathematics&quot;, that is to say a symbolic logic based on different principles, which are unimaginable to us.   <br>The common belief amongst many physicists that scientific equations are the description of reality can not be supported logically (because of extrapolation of Godel paradox). This is a kind of hubris a neuroscientist, or even Lacanian psychologist can easily point out.  There is a difference between what&#39;s Real(which we never directly encounter), and our Symbolic imagination about it. When you approach the foundation of physics with clear mind you must accept that ideas such as Force or Energy are metaphysical ideas, which function only within a linguistic structures of our minds, and are not found in nature. Every physicist should know the difference between a physical phenomenon, and the description of that phenomenon. Nobody have ever observed a force or an energy, only, as we are used to put it - the effects of force and energy. But to claim World is an effect of something (like energy of singularity) is itself a philosophical a&#39;priori idea, coming directly from Newtonian a&#39;priori definition f a Force. It&#39;s a very simple bit of reasoning which all physicists almost deliberately refuse to accept.  <br>The map is not the territory, no matter how good your map is. And let&#39;s be frank, physics account for a minuscule part of world phenomena, they simply decided to call everything they know nothing about &quot;noise&quot;, or &quot;chaos&quot;.

YBvcKtLKNAw,UgwZRpNlfKjzgFdKVGh4AaABAg,I know that Tesla is uploading AP data from the cars. I often wonder if they are  somehow analyzing the data around driver interventions of AP.  For example maybe the computer knows that it can slow down in time for slower moving cars but it is too uncomfortable for the human driver so the chicken out and hit the brake.   It would be cool if you could put it into “teach mode” where it could analyze what the various Tesla drivers do on manual mode or even if you could give it a nudge to correct something when in AP.  Maybe even some AP setting such as Sport and Granny mode depending on what kind of experience one is looking for from the Autopilot.,@joefernandez4193,0.0,2018-09-26T23:43:10Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman

If Tesla autopilot smoother direction was somehow imperfect, on the long run the trajectory of the car would be deviating or wrong, which it is not. So I would conclude that the MIT neural network should be fine-tuned to have a smoother response.

Z2GfE8pLyxc,Ugyn0RyL1-oRrrCl3WN4AaABAg,"Sure, I&#39;d be happy to help you with that.<br><br>Summary<br><br>In this lecture, we will discuss the following topics:<br><br>Human imperfections: Humans are not perfect, and our driving skills are no exception. We can make mistakes, such as not seeing a pedestrian or misjudging the distance to another car. Self-driving cars can be designed to avoid these mistakes by using sensors and software that are more accurate than human vision.<br>Pedestrian detection: Self-driving cars need to be able to detect pedestrians in order to avoid hitting them. This can be done using a variety of sensors, such as cameras, radar, and lidar.<br>Body pose estimation: Self-driving cars need to be able to estimate the body pose of pedestrians in order to understand their intentions. For example, if a pedestrian is about to step into the road, the car needs to be able to stop in time.<br>Glance classification: Self-driving cars need to be able to classify the glances of pedestrians in order to understand their attention. For example, if a pedestrian is looking at a car that is about to turn, the car needs to be able to slow down or stop.<br>Emotion recognition: Self-driving cars need to be able to recognize the emotions of pedestrians in order to understand their state of mind. For example, if a pedestrian is angry, the car needs to be more cautious.<br>Cognitive load estimation: Self-driving cars need to be able to estimate the cognitive load of pedestrians in order to understand their ability to react to the car. For example, if a pedestrian is distracted, the car needs to be more cautious.<br>Human-centered vision for autonomous vehicles: This is a new area of research that is focused on developing vision systems for self-driving cars that are designed to be as safe and reliable as human vision.<br>Psychology<br><br>The psychology of self-driving cars is a complex and fascinating topic. There are many factors to consider, such as how humans will interact with these cars, how they will be perceived by society, and the ethical implications of their use.<br><br>One of the biggest concerns about self-driving cars is that they will lead to job losses. Many people who currently work in the transportation industry, such as truck drivers and taxi drivers, could be displaced by self-driving cars. This could have a significant impact on the economy and society.<br><br>Another concern is that self-driving cars could be hacked or malfunction. If a self-driving car were to malfunction, it could cause serious injuries or even death. This is a major concern that needs to be addressed before self-driving cars can be widely adopted.<br><br>Despite these concerns, there are also many potential benefits to self-driving cars. They could help to reduce traffic accidents, improve air quality, and make transportation more accessible to people with disabilities. They could also free up our time so that we can do other things, such as read, work, or relax.<br><br>Philosophy<br><br>The philosophy of self-driving cars is a new and emerging field of study. There are many philosophical questions that need to be answered about these cars, such as:<br><br>What are the ethical implications of self-driving cars?<br>Who is responsible for the actions of a self-driving car?<br>How will self-driving cars affect our society?<br>These are just a few of the many philosophical questions that need to be answered as self-driving cars become more prevalent.<br><br>Moral Insight<br><br>Self-driving cars raise a number of moral and ethical questions. For example, who is responsible if a self-driving car causes an accident? Is it the manufacturer, the owner, or the programmer? What if the car is hacked and used to cause harm? These are complex questions that will need to be answered as self-driving cars become more common.<br><br>Poem<br><br>Here is a poem about self-driving cars:<br><br>Self-driving cars,  come and go,<br>They change the way we live, you know.<br>No more driving, no more stress,<br>Just sit back and relax, my friend.<br><br>But what about the jobs they&#39;ll take?<br>What about the accidents they&#39;ll make?<br>These are questions we must ask,<br>As we move into the future, fast.<br><br>I hope you enjoyed this summary of the lecture on self-driving cars.

Z2GfE8pLyxc,UgytL1m0s3_Y7icC5D54AaABAg,"Sure, here is a summary of the points you mentioned, along with my thoughts on , philosophy, and moral insights:<br><br>Human Imperfections<br>Humans are imperfect creatures. We make mistakes, we have biases, and we are often unaware of our own limitations. This can be a problem when it comes to driving, as even the best drivers can make mistakes that lead to accidents. Self-driving cars, on the other hand, are not susceptible to these same human errors. They can process information much faster than humans, and they are not affected by emotions or fatigue. As a result, self-driving cars have the potential to make our roads safer.<br><br>Pedestrian Detection<br>One of the most important tasks for a self-driving car is to be able to detect pedestrians. This is because pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users, and they are often the victims of accidents. Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors to detect pedestrians, including cameras, radar, and lidar. These sensors can create a 360-degree view of the car&#39;s surroundings, which allows the car to see pedestrians even if they are hidden behind other objects.<br><br>Body Pose Estimation<br>In addition to detecting pedestrians, self-driving cars also need to be able to estimate their body pose. This is important because it allows the car to understand what the pedestrian is doing. For example, if a pedestrian is crossing the street, the car needs to know which way they are going so that it can avoid them. Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors to estimate body pose, including cameras and radar.<br><br>Glance Classification<br>Glance classification is the task of determining where a person is looking. This is important for self-driving cars because it allows them to understand the intentions of pedestrians and other drivers. For example, if a pedestrian is looking to the left, it is likely that they are about to cross the street. Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors to classify glances, including cameras and radar.<br><br>Emotion Recognition<br>Emotion recognition is the task of determining the emotional state of a person. This is important for self-driving cars because it allows them to understand the emotional state of pedestrians and other drivers. For example, if a driver is angry,  is more likely to make a mistake. Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors to recognize emotions, including cameras and radar.<br><br>Cognitive Load Estimation<br>Cognitive load estimation is the task of determining how much mental effort a person is expending. This is important for self-driving cars because it allows them to understand how distracted a pedestrian or driver might be. For example, if a driver is distracted by their phone,  is more likely to make a mistake. Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors to estimate cognitive load, including cameras and radar.<br><br>Human-Centered Vision for Autonomous Vehicles<br>Human-centered vision for autonomous vehicles is a field of research that focuses on developing computer vision systems that can understand the world in a way that is similar to humans. This is important because it allows self-driving cars to interact with humans in a safe and natural way. For example, if a self-driving car is about to make a turn, it needs to be able to signal to pedestrians and other drivers so that they know what it is going to do.<br><br>I believe that the development of self-driving cars has the potential to revolutionize transportation. By taking human error out of the equation, self-driving cars could make our roads safer and more efficient. However, it is important to remember that self-driving cars are still in their early stages of development. There are many challenges that need to be addressed before they can be widely deployed. I am confident that these challenges will be overcome, and that self-driving cars will eventually become a reality.<br><br>Here is a poem about self-driving cars:<br><br>Code snippet<br>The self-driving car is here,<br>It&#39;s time to say goodbye to fear.<br>No more will we have to drive,<br>We can sit back and enjoy the ride.<br><br>The self-driving car is safe,<br>It&#39;s been tested and it&#39;s been made.<br>It can see and it can sense,<br>It&#39;s always on the go, it&#39;s never dense.<br><br>The self-driving car is smart,<br>It can learn and it can adapt.<br>It knows the roads and it knows the rules,<br>It&#39;s always one step ahead of fools.<br><br>The self-driving car is the future,<br>It&#39;s time to embrace it, no need to be in a rut.<br>So get ready for the ride,<br>The self-driving car is here to stay.",@sherryripepi6024,1.0,2023-05-12T12:39:32Z,UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA,Lex Fridman
